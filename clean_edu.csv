However, current cybersecurity education has not kept pace with the rapidly changing world of modern computing technologies.  This project will produce curricular materials that will allow instructors to teach cybersecurity as it relates to cloud computing environments.  A set of reusable virtual platforms will be developed, that will be used by a wide audience to effectively learn network and system security in cloud computing.  The curricular materials that will be developed as a result of this project will result in more efficient student learning and engagement, which over time will lead to a better trained and prepared security workforce.   Feedback from students using the materials will allow for the development of more effective teaching methods.<br/><br/>The undergraduate and graduate cybersecurity curriculum will be updated by developing a series of laboratory exercises under the context of cloud environments.   In each laboratory exercise students will be provided with the background knowledge needed to complete the exercise, and then using a reusable framework, students will develop their own code and conduct experiments independently.  Students will be taught how to analyze experimental results and summarize the attack and defense strategies learned from the experiments.  These course materials will allow students to become familiar with the major security and privacy issues in cloud computing, become aware of the latest progress in cloud security research, deepen their understanding of the basic concepts of network and system security, and learn the important programming and system skills via hands-on experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are plenty of publicly available AI approaches to cybersecurity, successful use depends on users? technical and soft skills. Moreover, AI-based approaches have been intensely scrutinized with respect to their security and ethics, delaying deployment. AI itself can be attacked and there can also be issues with discrimination in AI-based classification.  Thus, for AI to be effectively and quickly adopted for cybersecurity, AI security and ethics need to be assured. Training cybersecurity professionals to understand how to effectively use AI for cybersecurity and to be aware of AI security and ethics issues is critical for effective design and deployment of AI-based cybersecurity solutions. Future cybersecurity professionals must also be able effectively to communicate relevant information related to AI-based security mechanisms and policies to a variety of stakeholders.  This project will design competency-driven educational activities focusing on AI techniques for cybersecurity that will increase the effective and ethical application of AI-enhanced cybersecurity. <br/><br/>The project?s educational approach is based on four interrelated pillars. The first pillar focuses on educational activities covering a systematic AI-powered approach to cybersecurity, based on defender and attacker perspectives. The second pillar focuses on educational activities covering a systematic analysis of categories of AI attack and corresponding mitigation techniques. The third and fourth pillars focus on AI ethics and approaches to cybersecurity communications, respectively. A combination of social, philosophical, and technical perspectives will create a unique approach to cybersecurity communication. Together, the pillars provide a systematic perspective of AI-powered cybersecurity. They provide both foundational and technical competencies related to AI ethics and cybersecurity communication that benefit multiple stakeholders, from students and educators to employers and regulators. An important goal of the project is to make sure that students and educators understand that cybersecurity, including AI-based defense techniques, requires deployment of different types of defense approaches.  The project includes design of educational projects, focusing on well-known data breaches and other types of attack and how AI-based security techniques could prevent or mitigate these attacks.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, there is great potential for synthetic biology to touch almost every aspect of our daily lives. Given the promise of synthetic biology to benefit society, there is growing need to better understand the rules of life by which we may engineer biology, and to develop a diverse, synthetic biology-trained, entrepreneurial workforce. Today, synthetic biology concepts are primarily taught within traditional disciplinary boundaries, creating barriers to synergizing concepts across disciplines that could result in deeper understanding of biology and increased breakthrough innovations for society. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Center for Synthetic Biology at Northwestern University will break down these barriers by training graduate students using a new model for synthetic biology training, which specifically bridges disciplinary boundaries. This project anticipates training one hundred forty five (145) PhD students, including seventeen (17) funded trainees, from applied mathematics, biology, biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, and medicine degree programs.<br/><br/>The guiding concepts of this training program are focused on Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL) through a synthetic approach: students will learn the principles of living systems across length and time scales?from molecules, to cells, to organisms, to communities?and then demonstrate this understanding through thesis research spanning the interfaces between these scales. This training program is inherently convergent. By integrating concepts across disciplines (e.g., biology, engineering, mathematics, data science), the program will help develop a core curriculum for synthetic biology training. The training plan consists of: (i) curricular development that introduces core biological principles along scales; (ii) skills workshops that give students core competencies in communication, computer programming, and experimental design; (iii) an experiential project within education, entrepreneurship, and policy tracks that prepares students to translate their training to impact broader society; (iv) integration of ethical considerations throughout each component; and (v) co-mentored thesis research that prepares students to work at the interface of different biological scales. The primary objectives of the project are to create a core curriculum for synthetic biology training, train synthetic biologists to communicate scientific ideas to diverse societal stakeholders, grow the synthetic biology workforce, broaden participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities, and build infrastructure to sustain innovative synthetic biology ecosystem.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

This technology is largely based on standard American English and the misconception that there is a single, idealized variety of American English, which conflicts with the true diversity of language users. Many U.S. speakers use a regional variety of American English, African American Vernacular English, a signed language, a language other than English, or have some form of communication disorder. As the U.S. population is becoming older, age-related hearing loss and language impairments will also increase. The linguistic sophistication of technology has not kept pace with the growing linguistic diversity within the U.S.  This technology is intended to improve the lives of humans and society at large, and people increasingly depend on it for access to governmental, community, health, and educational services, making the technology?s current reliance on standard American English problematic. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the Pennsylvania State University will educate a new generation of experts in human-technology interactions to address this issue. The project anticipates training 48 graduate students, including 23 funded trainees, from graduate programs in Psychology, German, Spanish, Communication Science and Disorders, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences and Technology, and Learning Design and Technology. The comprehensive two-year traineeships will prepare trainees to address key challenges in human-technology interactions. Improvements in human-technology interactions will help ensure the full participation of individuals with diverse language backgrounds, fostering an equal, diverse, and inclusive society.<br/><br/>By applying integrated learning and transdisciplinary team science principles, trainees will be prepared to bridge the gap between language science and technology. Trainees will also be prepared to think beyond disciplinary boundaries. This approach is considered optimal to prepare the next generation for the future of work. In a two-year program culminating in the new graduate certificate ?Linguistic Diversity and Technology?, trainees will complete cross-disciplinary courses and professional development in language and technology. Trainees will work on transdisciplinary team research projects that address tractable goal and produce clear products, such as a design project, pilot application, or research study focused on integrating language science and human-technology interaction. Trainees will also participate in seminars, research events, mentoring, and a linguistic diversity outreach program. They will complete the program with an internship with academic and private sector extramural partners to support careers bridging linguistics and technology, both inside and outside academia, in national and international settings.

The antibiotic resistance problem is inherently challenging, as conflicting drivers of the problem must be addressed simultaneously if society is to continue to benefit from these life-saving drugs. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) will tackle this problem by equipping the next generation of scientists and policymakers with the technical and professional skills necessary to successfully work in convergent systems and harness the latest advances in data science to inform solutions. The Convergence at the Interfaces of Policy, Data Science, and Environmental Science and Engineering to Combat the Spread of Antibiotic Resistance (CIP-CAR) NRT project addresses a compelling need for training in science-based policy and convergent research across the graduate curriculum at Virginia Tech, nationally, and globally. The project anticipates training 45 Ph.D. students, including 33 funded trainees, from Policy, Data Science, and Environmental Science and Engineering programs.<br/><br/>The CIP-CAR NRT is a Ph.D.-level program that combines cutting-edge research with four training elements: a graduate certificate in CIP-CAR Science, Technology, and Engineering in Policy (STEP), boot camps and workshops, a field project, and a transdisciplinary dissertation chapter. The graduate certificate consists of 13 credit hours, focused on ethically engaging with stakeholders and the appropriate use of data science to inform solutions, with modules and case studies devoted to antibiotic resistance and other relevant convergent research topics.  Bootcamps will be held annually to orient new students to the NRT. Workshops will be held bi-annually as a forum for trainees to share their research with the CIP-CAR community and to learn and practice transdisciplinary team science, science communication, ethics, and stakeholder engagement skills. Field project partners span a range of rural, urban, and international locales working with communities, wastewater treatment plants, data consulting, and international research labs to provide opportunities to deepen skills in stakeholder engagement and translating research to practice. At least one dissertation chapter will result from a transdisciplinary team science effort with trainee peers and faculty representing different disciplines. The STEP graduate certificate will be available to all Virginia Tech graduate students (master?s and Ph.D.). This will further broaden the impact and sustain the CIP-CAR program beyond NSF funding.

Natural disasters and climate stressors make already pervasive inequities and environmental injustices in coastal communities even more pronounced.  Therefore, there is an imperative for a workforce that can investigate how coastal regions are changing in response to human and natural stressors. The resulting science can then be translated to aid communities in assessing the risks of, and actions to address, these challenges.  A variety of agencies and stakeholders routinely collect environmental and socio-economic data that could help to address these problems. However, the data required for traditional analyses or modeling approaches are rarely collected. Therefore, understanding the drivers of coastal change requires creative ways to make sense of available diverse data sets. Trainees in the Coastal Community Environmental Data Scholars (CCEDS) program will represent multiple graduate degree programs and undertake activities that train them in how to apply data science skills while building their confidence as data science scholars ? an important issue as many students coming from backgrounds like geology or biology may see data science as a barrier to success rather than a pathway to career enablement. The trainees will extend their dissertation research by applying their basic science skills in partnerships with local communities to identify and solve problems of concern. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to East Carolina University (ECU) will train interdisciplinary scientists and engineers to address problems of critical importance to coastal communities via data science. The project anticipates training 36 Ph.D. students, including 18 funded trainees, from two of ECU?s flagship doctoral programs, the Integrated Coastal Science program and the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Biology, Biomedicine, and Chemistry. <br/><br/>Data-driven tools like empirical dynamical modeling and deep learning have an advantage over traditional modeling and analysis methods when insufficient information is available to develop mechanistic models of environmental processes and their coupling with human activities.  These data-driven tools can bring new insights to the understanding of complex systems, particularly in detecting changes in system behavior that can be complemented with more traditional studies to understand why or how the change occurred.  The proposed traineeship supports research activities focused on the convergence of two distinct Ph.D. programs and ensures the preparation of an interdisciplinary data science workforce, especially important for economically developing coastal regions.  Trainees will build on their data science experience by taking part in a 2-year sequence of six program activities involving practices supporting convergent research, science communication, and community-engaged research. Further, the traineeship is based on and tests the effectiveness of best practices for training students to overcome issues such as imposter phenomena and stereotype threats related to data science. The experiential activities are structured to build trainees? confidence and identity while preparing them for real-world data science jobs within and beyond academia.  This program will benefit society by training a diverse workforce to collaborate with community partners and use data-driven activities to mitigate environmental issues that impact equity and social justice in coastal regions.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

This integration creates tension between the opportunities for ubiquitous AI to transform the workplace and emerging risks around bias, security, and privacy. Currently, AI tools are being developed at an unusually rapid pace, and deployed into environments where value maximization precedes regulation. The next generation of innovators accordingly needs a new kind of training. For algorithm designers, this means understanding and being sensitive to the context in which their creations may operate in unexpected ways through interaction with users in socio-technical ecosystems. For system designers, this means knowing enough about how AI tools are evolving to reimagine how tasks and processes could and should transform work in ways that fully leverage the potential power of AI tools. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the George Washington University will address these needs by training doctoral students, master?s students, and graduate certificate students who will be prepared to make convergent research contributions to AI in the future workplace in a way that positively impacts society. The project anticipates training one-hundred and twenty (120) students, including twenty-five (25) funded Ph.D. trainees, primarily serving students in the discipline of computer science and systems engineering but with close interaction with the students and faculty in law, media, public affairs, public health, and international affairs.<br/><br/>This NRT aims to educate researchers capable of ?co-designing? AI algorithms and work systems to unlock new opportunities in both the capabilities of new systems and their ?trustworthiness.? To accomplish this, the educational program aims to instill the following: 1) Comfort in bridging distant disciplines. Through novel onboarding sequences and shared experience of cross-disciplinary engagement with peers, mentors, and industry, the program will educate interdisciplinary, ?comb-shaped? scholars who have a solid base in either AI algorithms or work system design and are also comfortable engaging deeply with other disciplinary areas fundamental to their chosen research problems. 2) Appreciation for contextually-embedded problem-solving. Important issues arise when well-intentioned systems evolve post-deployment. The NRT emphasizes context early and often as research is being formulated. Summer bootcamps will facilitate research problem formulation that enables early cycles of feedback and testing with a broad set of stakeholders. Additionally, by intertwining students from different programs by engaging them in a professional certificate through the onboarding sequences, informal opportunities will be created for natural cross-pollination from theory to practice and back. 3) Holistic professional identities. Although many Ph.D. programs are starting to build scaffolding to support ?soft-skills,? this usually occurs separately from core program elements. This program?s strategy is to make communication, leadership, teamwork, and ethics central to each program element. The bootcamps and seminars will also provide structured opportunities for students to learn, practice, and reinforce their strategies, e.g., engaging with ethics in context. 4) Valuing diverse perspectives in decision-making. AI algorithms tend to exacerbate existing biases, making it especially important to bring diverse perspectives into decision-making to mitigate unintended consequences. Currently, AI adoption is being driven by a relatively homogenous group. There is a need to increase participation from underrepresented groups and expose students to the value of bringing in diverse perspectives early in the process.   <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

The program's goal is to train a new generation of biological scientists and engineers who can work across disciplines, are fluent in data analytics and experimental methods, and who will advance fundamental research in quantitative biology and bioengineering. Cell and developmental biology are in transition from qualitative observational sciences to quantitative, data-rich fields that leverage modeling and design principles from physics and engineering. Advances in imaging and sequencing technologies, paired with machine learning and computer vision tools, are having a transformative impact on quantitative cell biology. To take full advantage of these technologies, the modern biological engineer needs to be fluent both in the design of biological experiments and in data mining strategies to integrate information across scales (temporal and from genetic/molecular to cellular and tissue scales). DDB seeks to provide students with the breadth to collaborate across disciplines meaningfully and with the depth to answer biological questions with scientific rigor supported by knowledge of and experience with data science approaches. The project anticipates training 70 Ph.D. students, including 30 funded trainees, from doctoral programs in: biological engineering, biomolecular science & engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, molecular, cellular and developmental biology, mechanical engineering, and physics. <br/><br/>Through DDB, students will learn how to design experiments; acquire and integrate multi-modal, disparate data; and integrate machine learning and computational approaches to extract patterns and meaning from biological data to understand and leverage heterogeneity in stem-cell-derived models. Trainees will be supported by a new curriculum, which will serve as the basis of an emergent Biological Engineering Ph.D. program. Onboarding will include a structured course on seminal research papers and best practices for designing interdisciplinary inquiry. Armed with these training elements, students will be immersed in an in-vivo research experience to conduct hands-on redesign of seminal experiments and to personally implement advanced research methods to test the conclusions of these seminal papers. Students will also engage in co-mentored research rotation projects across diverse labs (experimental and modeling). To support self-reflection, deliberate career planning, and self-efficacy, the program will deploy a three-pronged mentoring plan, including a faculty advisor, peer feedback, and self-assessment through individual development plans.

In these early days of quantum technology development, hardware knowledge is essential for software engineers to optimize architectures, efficiently implement algorithms, and correct errors. The breakthroughs needed in the materials for scalable quantum devices requires materials and device scientists and computer architecture engineers to be trained in quantum information. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the University of Washington (UW) will address these needs by training master?s and doctoral students in an interdisciplinary program in quantum information science and technology (QIST). The traineeship anticipates providing training to one hundred and ninety (190) students including twenty-two (22) funded trainees, by combining disciplines in quantum information (chemistry, physics, applied mathematics, materials science & engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science), interactions with national laboratories and industry partners,  project-based learning on commercially available cloud quantum computers, and hands-on research in QIST. There is a growing national need for US quantum scientists to meet the current workforce demands from US national laboratories and industries (including startups and established companies). This need will be met by (1) increasing UW graduate students? QIST knowledge and skills, (2) increasing the participation of women in QIST by effectively implementing targeted recruitment and retention strategies and introduction of QIST concepts into UW?s undergraduate curricula, and (3) developing publicly available educational materials from our most innovative courses. <br/><br/>At the core of the traineeship program is the ?learn, practice, apply? approach with a heavy emphasis on project-based learning.

At the same time, increased life expectancy has resulted in a significant expansion of the nation?s elderly population. The combination of rising health care costs and increased life spans poses tough challenges for many families. The widespread disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated these national challenges and health disparities, particularly in rural communities with poor health rankings. These problems could be addressed by new advances in digital health (DH) and how we train the next generation of scientists, engineers, and healthcare professionals to develop and deploy such advances. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to West Virginia University (WVU) will address these challenges by developing a new graduate education and traineeship model to prepare professionals who can work in collaborative transdisciplinary teams to develop and apply data science and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in addressing difficult problems in DH, including in rural areas. The project anticipates training twenty-four (24) funded and forty (40) unfunded MS and PhD students from different backgrounds, including engineering, computer science, medicine, health sciences, physical sciences, and economics.<br/><br/>Data science and AI techniques have been successfully applied to address a diverse range of health problems. The traineeship will address how to scale and build on DH successes by developing: 1) effective and transferable frameworks for training a larger and more diverse workforce with the foundations underlying these advances while inculcating soft skills beyond traditional coursework and ensuring rural communities are served; and 2) new ways to address other problems in DH related to the nature of DH data, the significant data analysis gap, and computational problems. A key element in the traineeship is its specific attention to the ?bridges? required for effective and scalable traineeship and workforce development in DH. These bridges will connect: (a) different fields within health sciences, and across other areas, including barriers posed by the distinct terminologies used by different fields; (b) different scales of study in biomedicine (from micro to macro) via integration of different data types; and (c) underrepresented groups and innovative research in DH to ensure diversity in the traineeship. This diversity will be achieved by: 1) recruiting and supporting success for participants from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, those who are rural, those from the first generation in their families to go to college, and/or those from other groups underserved in STEM, and 2) by bridging Primarily Undergraduate Institutions and large research institutions. Trainees will develop novel approaches to tackle some of the core problems in AI (e.g., trust and safe decision making, scalable data structures, and attention-based information integration). Trainees will apply these approaches to specific problems in health, such as myocardial fingerprinting from echocardiograms and large-scale functional annotation in genomics. The project uses an innovative sequence of components to interweave the research theme, important professional skills (e.g., communication, ethics, leadership, collaboration), and coursework into the traineeship model without extending time-to-degree. Upon completion, trainees will be awarded a Certificate in DH.

For example, future engineers will create intelligent surgical instruments, autonomous robots that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to make clinical decisions, and tools that augment the performance and capabilities of surgeons. This will require a convergence of skillsets and knowledge to traverse technological, regulatory, ethical, and societal hurdles to create technologies that safely and successfully meet modern challenges. Most graduate engineering programs excel at teaching the fundamental tenets of their respective disciplines. However, graduate engineering curricula often lack the training that enables students to transcend their disciplines and engage in convergent research that involves not just other engineers, but also professionals from other STEM fields, medicine, business, and law. By engaging with these other disciplines, this traineeship will provide a more holistic and innovative approach for the professional formation of engineers to impact the future of advanced surgical technologies.   This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Duke University will train Master?s and Ph.D. students in the interdisciplinary fields of engineering, computer science, data science, and surgical technologies.  This project anticipates training a total of 230 students, including 30 NRT-funded trainees from Engineering, Computer Science, Math, Science and Society, and Statistics. The vision for this traineeship is to provide a new research and training framework for engineering and computer science graduate students to access other disciplines and thereby design advanced surgical technologies that integrate medical provider, societal, end-user, and patient needs throughout development and testing.<br/><br/>The proposed traineeship model combines classroom-based, research-based, and professional development activities completed concurrently over two years, leading to four core learning outcomes: (1) a common knowledge base; (2) subject expertise across multiple, convergent disciplines; (3) a translational experience at the forefront of surgical technology research and development; and (4) professional development opportunities that prepare students for both academic and industry-based careers in surgical technology. A specific novelty of the proposed program is the use of topical primers interconnected with mini design challenges in which trainees will shadow a surgeon, use current surgical tools and robots, and take knowledge primers in robotics, surgery, machine learning, rapid prototyping, ethics, intellectual property, and medical law; these activities are designed to enable students to acquire a diverse knowledge base and necessary  professional development quickly.

Harnessing this data revolution requires broadening the participation of U.S. citizens in the data science workforce, especially of women and other under-represented groups. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Stony Brook University (the State University of New York at Stony Brook) will prepare a diverse pool of students to become fluent in both data sciences and human-centered sciences. The program will enable students to conduct convergent research in problem domains that blend data science with deep disciplinary knowledge. The project anticipates training sixty-eight (68) Ph.D. students, including thirty-four (34) NRT-funded trainees, recruited from both the human-centered sciences (HCS, consisting of Psychology, Linguistics, Economics, Neurobiology & Behavior, Political Science, and Sociology) and the data sciences (DS, consisting of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics). In the U.S., scientifically oriented domestic students tend to gather in distinct siloes, with significantly higher proportions of women in HCS than in DS fields. HCS students are well-trained in the traditional empirical methods of their fields. However, many do not identify as ""data scientists."" These HCS students may lack the preparation to dive into graduate coursework in computer science to acquire cutting-edge research skills in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data that could empower their research. And many DS students lack a deep theoretical and practical understanding of how datasets are collected and their limitations. Moreover, DS students may lack the skills to assess the impacts of data-based technology upon human beings and society. <br/><br/>In this two-pathway training model, DS trainees will take graduate coursework in an HCS domain, earning a certificate in the Human-Centered Sciences. Meanwhile, HCS trainees will take any needed intensive bridge courses to prepare them for graduate coursework in DS and earn an Artificial Intelligence certificate. Trainees will come together in three team-taught research practica centered on a relevant and inclusive theme: bias?in data, in humans, and in institutions. These practica will focus on discovering how the use of powerful quantitative methods can camouflage biases (both implicit and explicit) that, in a given context, advantage some human beings and disadvantage others. Both trainees and trainers will practice techniques for detecting and addressing biases in themselves and their research, as well as within social and institutional settings. Together, they will join convergent research collaborations that target pervasive problems of inequity and the ethical uses of technology. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

However, there is growing concern that STEM graduate education may be falling short on preparing the nation?s workforce to face these global challenges. Equipping students with transformative skills in STEM is necessary for their future success, and for the sustainable development of society. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Pennsylvania State University will engage underrepresented graduate students in real-world international experiences. Students will develop creative solutions to complex sustainable development challenges as an integral part of team working in close collaboration with local communities. Each year, a cohort of 12 graduate students will advance technical, ecological, and social strategies for sustainable development in 1- to 6-month research internships at different sites around the world. To empower them to effectively and compassionately advocate for change where it is needed most, participants will also receive modular professional development training in science communication, multiculturalism, global leadership, and environmental justice. As a result, students will be better prepared to pursue diverse professional careers in sustainable development, increasing the capacity of the future workforce to solve important environmental challenges. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this IGE project is to improve the scientific basis of environmental decision-making, and increase the likelihood of successful implementation of sustainability strategies now and into the future.

They need a story,? explained Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. Telling stories, while remaining true to the data, is a defining challenge of this century. Narratives are persuasive but not objective; numbers are often objective but not persuasive. For science to provide the broadest beneficial impact to society, its findings need to be communicated with both scientific integrity and authentic empathy. Although a growing number of interdisciplinary careers demand this dual fluency, current graduate curricula do not adequately prepare students to master these skills. At many institutions, training remains siloed, and curricular partitions separate those with skills in data science theory, deep domain-specific knowledge, and policy analysis. These partitions do not map well to the real world, where the most pressing social and environmental challenges demand interdisciplinary innovation and collaboration. Effective interdisciplinary collaboration requires a level of exposure, experience, and practice in real-world problem-solving that combines numbers and narratives. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Tufts University will address this need by educating Data Professionals who will synthesize numbers and narratives to design and implement data-driven solutions that are technically efficient and contextually appropriate. The project anticipates training over 140 masters and doctoral trainees: 20 NRT Fellows with stipends, 50 NRT Problem-Focused Immersion Fellows, 60 NRT Travel Awardees, and 12 NRT Module Developers. <br/><br/>This NRT will train two types of data professionals. Policy-Savvy Data Experts?primarily from STEM disciplines?will advance the frontiers of data science and will be able to (a) identify, analyze, and solve a problem with the appropriate data-driven theory, tools, and techniques; and (b) adapt and acquire skill sets to harness emerging data-focused technologies, techniques, and tools. At the same time, they will have training in policy-relevant skills and be able to collaborate with the less technically trained decision-makers in their workplace. Data-Proficient Decision Makers?primarily from non-STEM disciplines?will use data in policy development and decision making. They will be able to (a) collaborate effectively on teams that include users and producers of data, including scientists, engineers, practitioners, and decision-makers with different backgrounds and perspectives; and (b) provide data-informed advice in an actionable way as well as broadly communicate those results for effective action. Trainees will have hands-on experience with a growing portfolio of data science tools and methods that facilitate the rapid translation of data into actionable information. Training will be grounded in finding, defining and resolving problems from both data-rich (i.e., big data) and data-scarce contexts common to many real-world resource problems ? including those at the intersection of Food, Energy, Water, and Ecosystems. This NRT model will provide an interdisciplinary theory-practice synthesis by building on two potentially transformative components: (1) Modular Course Elements (MCEs); and (2) Problem-Focused Immersion (PFI). A unique aspect of this NRT is the use of a common database across the MCEs, akin to the adoption of a common book in Writing Across the Curriculum programs. The proposed problem-focused and theory-practice synthesis strategy will foster deeper actionable collaboration among data science experts, domain experts, practitioners, and decision-makers. With this project?s commitment and plan to educate Data Professionals from STEM and non-STEM disciplines, it will actively pursue broadening participation in data science from under-represented groups. Content-rich, modular and adaptable nature of program elements will make them transferrable across disciplines and institutions and sustainable beyond the NRT grant period.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

The health, environmental, and economic burden of hazardous byproducts of this process falls disproportionately on the most vulnerable communities. To drive change towards a sustainable future and improved outcomes for all, there is a need to train future leaders in the circular economy that maximizes use of renewable materials, increases the efficiency of manufacturing processes, upcycles wastes into valuable byproducts, and minimizes the harm of irreducible waste streams. Despite much effort, educational models training students to become experts in increasingly isolated fields and without regard for communication with stakeholders have not yielded the desired results. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to Worcester Polytechnic Institute will address this demand by establishing the CEDAR Program (Circular Economy and Data Analytics Engineering Research for Sustainability) to educate an outward facing community of scholars versed in data-driven sustainable engineering solutions to the challenges preventing transition to a circular economy. The CEDAR traineeship anticipates providing a comprehensive training opportunity for one hundred and twenty (120) graduate students, including thirty (30) funded PhD-level trainees, in disciplines ranging from chemical sciences (chemistry, biology, physics, engineering) to data sciences (computing, business analytics, statistics, mathematics) with a convergent focus on advancement of circular economies. <br/><br/>The CEDAR traineeship interweaves technical and social considerations and focuses on the well-being of our society. This integrated traineeship in data and chemical sciences will develop leaders ready to transform industrial chemical processes towards a green and circular economy by addressing fundamental problems in three critical areas: (1) development of atom and energy efficient processes, (2) understanding and deploying upcycling, and (3) minimizing harm from the irreducible waste streams that cannot be avoided. Communication and collaboration across traditional disciplinary boundaries are fostered via professional workshops and convergent research seminars team-taught by instructors from distinct disciplines. To drive change, trainees learn leadership skills by participating in multi-way exchanges of ideas and advocacy with audiences ranging from the general public to academia, government, and industry. Connections with industry made by participating in CEDAR community retreats, CEDAR External Advisory Board meetings and in the internship program will strengthen trainee professional and career development, and infuse talent into the sustainable economy. The CEDAR program will tackle the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM disciplines by employing innovative minority-centric recruiting strategies using peer ambassadors to cultivate relationships with faculty and potential students at the program?s partner universities, creating pipelines to CEDAR.

This project is aimed at training the next generation of scientists and leaders who can help build resilient communities that are prepared for, can effectively respond to, and can quickly recover from damaging hazard events. To better understand the complexities of resilience planning and improve predictability, methodological advancements that integrate multiple layers of information are critically needed. Specifically, progress requires a better understanding of the factors that impact resilience in natural, social, and built environmental systems; how these systems interact; and the effectiveness of specific resilience-based measures and communication strategies. In the absence of such advancements, disparities in the resilience of communities will persist, and decision-making efforts to reduce climate-related hazard impacts may be misguided. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Auburn University will prepare a future workforce that will build climate-related disaster resilience in the southeastern United States by training individuals at the MS and PhD levels. Students will conduct research within an integrated and multidisciplinary framework with the aim to better understand, predict, and communicate the resilience of natural, social and built environmental systems. The project anticipates training thirty-six (36) MS and PhD students, including eighteen (18) funded trainees, across earth systems science, engineering, geosciences, forestry and wildlife sciences, climate science, data science, agriculture, and social science disciplines.<br/><br/>The goal of this NRT project is to address interdisciplinary research questions concerning resilience to climate-related natural hazards and disasters, while training the next generation of scientists and engineers to recognize the data-driven decision-making needs of stakeholders and to effectively communicate scientific information to stakeholder and public audiences.  The project will employ a transformative workshop-studio-internship training approach. Two-way exchanges and direct interactions between stakeholders and trainees will occur, exposing trainees to real-world problems and possible career pathways. In addition to working on directed thesis research, trainees will take: (1) a course on resilience and social vulnerability, (2) a course on science communication, (3) a studio course that brings trainees and stakeholders together to address real-world problems, (4) a summer internship working directly with stakeholders, and (5) a series of workshops focused on structured decision-making approaches. Trainees will acquire quantitative, qualitative, analytical, and collaborative skillsets; will learn to infer the types and magnitudes of climate effects on natural, human and built environmental systems across spatio-temporal scales; and will understand the actionable science needs of relevant stakeholders. Faculty will work with trainees to incorporate cutting-edge research into their theses. Research will examine how to optimize community preparation, response, and recovery from climate-hazard events that are common in the southeastern United States with results potentially informing approaches in other geographic regions with similar risks.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

A centuries-old model of doctoral mentoring assumed that students learn by working alongside their faculty advisors at the lab bench. However, research as evolved into a team activity with advisors and students serving different roles and rarely working together at the same task. In this environment, students typically learn most research skills from advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers rather than their faculty advisors. Cascading mentorship describes such a model of mentoring from a rich network of faculty and peers. Doctoral students who receive cascading mentorship are much more likely to develop strong research skills than those who do not regardless of the quality of mentoring received from their primary faculty advisors. However, not all students are trained in large, well-functioning labs with ready-made cascading mentorship networks. In addition, factors such as shared or dissimilar cultural identity with the majority of faculty and differences in first-generation students? access to faculty mentors, friends, or family members with doctoral degree experience may result in differences in the quality of mentoring. Thus, when doctoral programs fail to provide rich networks of cascading mentorship, it is the students from minority communities who are likely to suffer most.<br/><br/>In this project, approximately 65 advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in cognitive science will be trained to lead cascading mentorship groups of five to ten doctoral students each. The groups will use proven pedagogical methods to help members plan their research, organize their time, and learn to produce the forms of writing on which academic success depends such as: literature reviews, funding proposals, research reports, etc. This project will address research questions related to four scale-up challenges: 1) group leader effects, i.e., whether the approach works when these mentorship groups are led by advanced graduate students rather than by a faculty member; 2) implementation cost, i.e., whether these groups can be supported in a way that is affordable for most doctoral programs; 3) long-term effects of cascading mentorship over a period of years in a variety of domains including: writing quantity and quality; progress through the graduate program; mental health and well-being; and 4) broad suitability, i.e., whether the model is equally effective for all students or whether only a subset of students benefit. Results from this project will help departments decide whether to adopt a cascading mentorship model program-wide or offer this model as an option for a subset of students.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, research has shown AI techniques can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as adversarial perturbation and data poisoning, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes when decisions made by AI systems are manipulated. Despite significant research efforts in this area, the research community has disproportionately focused on only a few domains, such as image recognition, and a few simple adversarial setups. Meanwhile more security-critical domains, such as malware detection, and a variety of adversarial models that more fully represent the real-world, have been ignored. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare, contrast, and characterize the different approaches to developing robust AI systems because of the fragmented nature of efforts in this area. This also creates challenges for education efforts in AI and cybersecurity. This project aims to address these urgent issues with synergistic efforts in AI, cybersecurity, and education that will produce significant research and societal impacts. First, the results of the project will promote public awareness of the issues and research around the robustness AI via the dissemination of tools and materials. Second, the project will democratize research progress in robust AI to application domains that are currently underserved, such as malware detection. Third, the project represents a concrete step towards fostering a workforce with skills in building robust and secure AI systems. The platform developed by this project will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of California Irvine and made publicly available to researchers and educators. <br/>The specific aim of the project is to address issues of research fragmentation in robust and secure AI. The project team will develop a new platform, called Maestro, to simulate adversarial machine learning tasks, covering a variety of adversarial capabilities (access to gradients, model weights, predictions, etc.) for both attacks and defenses, under a formal access-control framework. The  Maestro platform  will make it easier to implement, compare, and develop novel adversarial ML algorithms, settings, and applications that have not been sufficiently explored, including backdoor exploitation of natural language processing (NLP), stealthy adversarial malware generation, and security analysis of program embedding. The architecture of Maestro not only provides a useful framework to structure pedagogical materials in AI and cybersecurity, but also will be used to build course materials using active learning and gamification strategies.  The latter will engage students while teaching them essential concepts about building reliable and robust AI systems.<br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

By simultaneously studying the hiring process at Big Tech firms from the demand side evaluations of job applicants by employers and supply side choices and preparation of job applicants, the research will illuminate the hidden factors that shape who is offered elite internships. It fills a fundamental gap in the knowledge base by investigating the role of class background in hiring for these STEM jobs.  While assumed to be minimal due to the emphasis on ?objective? technical skills, pilot data suggest hiring decisions for these internships are influenced by tacit markers of class background such as organizational fit, individual fit, social networks, and communication style.  Such inductive findings motivate the current project, which will examine the relationship between class background and the attainment of elite internships with a larger sample and more rigorous mixed-methods design.  The research will provide STEM organizations with concrete ways to facilitate equitable and inclusive hiring practices and enable underprivileged applicants to navigate the hiring process by equipping them with knowledge about the expectations of the dominant hiring culture.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to examine how class figures into the attainment of elite research internships in the top tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon.  Investigators will examine two research questions: (1) How does the role of class background shape internship attainment through gatekeeper evaluations? and (2) How does class background shape internship applicant preparation, interview performance and outcomes. Data will be collected primarily through interviews, observations at Big Tech recruitment events and internship preparation seminars, questionnaires.  The study is the first to study how class background shapes hiring in a technical profession, extends our understanding of how class shapes hiring beyond the influence of childhood participation in organized activities, and investigates how class shapes applicants? preparation, self-presentation, and hiring outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compounding this problem is the fact that many students are unaware of the interesting job opportunities available in the federal government. This project will provide scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students studying cybersecurity at Louisiana State University (LSU). Students will receive a solid education in cybersecurity, marketable skills, and exposure to cybersecurity opportunities available in the federal government. Recruiting students from populations currently underrepresented in the cybersecurity workforce, including women and minorities, will be a priority. This project will support the expansion of the cybersecurity workforce in the United States while nurturing highly-qualified cybersecurity students and enabling each of them to make a personal impact in a field that is critically important to national security.<br/><br/>LSU has a strong cybersecurity program that offers students the opportunity to study a variety of topics in applied cybersecurity and to conduct research using state-of-the-art facilities. The project will offer scholarships to 21 students over a five-year period to participate in an intensive academic program in cybersecurity, which includes several important activities.  These activities will include both coursework and research in cutting-edge areas such as memory forensics, reverse engineering, malware analysis, blockchains, machine learning, and network security. Students will also participate in a federal internship program and obtain at least one cybersecurity certification.<br/>  <br/>This project is supported by the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research project aims to model patterns of major behavior data among undergraduate women entering and exiting an engineering program prior to graduation, elucidate the cultural ecosystem of undergraduate engineering education and its relationship to women?s achievement motivation, and examine the structural modes of power, privilege, and socialization within the discipline.  Concurrently, the investigator proposes to implement a professional development plan that will expand the investigator?s skills in mixed-methods, longitudinal design, and analysis of large-scale institutional datasets, advanced statistical modeling techniques, and expertise in undergraduate engineering education curriculum development. The project will add significantly to the understanding of women?s experiences and decisions about engineering on a broad scale and generate information to improve practice in social science research, engineering education research, and higher education administration. <br/><br/>The study will be guided by input-environment models, ecological and ecosystems studies, and theories of identity-based motivation. The investigator will leverage the three approaches to investigate two research questions: (1) What patterns of engineering major-switching and course-taking behavior are related to retention and graduation among undergraduate women from 2006 to 2016?, (2a) How do perceptions of the undergraduate engineering education ecosystem compare among women who persist in the major and those who do not?, and (2b) Which experiences in this context are most meaningful to their achievement motivation in the field?  A mixed-methods research design will be used to examine diversity among women as well as hierarchies of privilege and power that structure academic life. The research focuses not only on the person but also on the interactions of individuals with their surroundings. The study also will address changes in embedded educational contexts over time and analyze the dynamic between retrospective accounts of alumni and recent reflections of current students.

However, the STEM learning environment is complex. Students are nested within teachers, and teachers are nested within schools (which in turn are nested within districts), which implies a multilevel structure. To date, most empirical research that uses multilevel modeling to examine the role of higher levels on variation in student outcomes does not examine the teacher level. The reason is that for many states, data linkages between students and teachers have been difficult to achieve. However, in the last five years, this situation has improved in many states, which makes this work now possible. This study seeks to further understanding of the STEM learning environment by 1) examining the extent to which mathematics and science achievement varies across students, teachers, schools, and districts and 2) examining the extent to which student, teacher, school, and district characteristics that are found in state administrative databases can be used to explain this variation at each level. This work will support advances in research and evaluation methodologies that will enable researchers to design more rigorous and comprehensive evaluations of STEM interventions and improve the accuracy of statistical power calculations. Broad dissemination of the resulting tools and techniques will provide access through freely available websites, and workshops and training opportunities to build capacity in the field for STEM researchers to design cluster randomized trials (CRTs) to answer questions beyond what works to for whom and under what conditions. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. Funding is also provided by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to 1) describing and explaining the landscape of the STEM learning environment, an environment which includes students, teachers, and schools, and 2) applying this empirical information in the design of STEM intervention studies to enable researchers to extend beyond the usual questions about if the intervention works and for which types of students or schools. By adding teacher level variables, this analysis would account for key teacher characteristics that may moderate the treatment effect. The research will also increase the efficiency in the design of CRTs of STEM interventions. Specifically, the findings from this study will improve the internal validity and cost-efficiency of evaluations of STEM interventions by increasing the accuracy of estimates for the full range of parameters needed to conduct power analyses, particularly when the teacher level is included. The high cost associated with CRTs makes it critical to plan accurate trials that do not overestimate the required sample size, and hence cost more than necessary, or underestimate the sample size and thereby reduce the potential to generate high-quality evidence of program effectiveness. Including the teacher level in intervention studies, a critical level in the delivery of any intervention, will allow for more testing of teacher characteristics that may moderate intervention effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A method of research to understand how teachers affect students is mediation analyses.  Mediation analyses decode how and why attributes are connected to student improvement by probing the intermediate developmental processes and behaviors of teachers that operationalize these relationships.  Multi-school or multisite mediation studies can build a multilayered body of evidence regarding if, how, and why specific attributes help improve student outcomes.  They can delineate how interventions (e.g., through professional development programs) might improve both teacher and student outcomes.  They can concurrently map out teacher development processes, create opportunities to discover, unpack and learn about variation in these processes, and accommodate naturally occurring variation within schools.  Unfortunately, there are scant literature and tools available on methods and strategies to intentionally design effective and efficient multi-school mediation studies in the context of teacher development and effectiveness.  In this project, this line of inquiry will be enhanced by developing a theoretical and empirical framework for multi-school mediation studies.  The proposed work aims to derive useful tools, that is new statistical estimators, principles, and strategies for multisite designs that are widely applicable across STEM areas.  It also intends to develop empirically-based strategies and software for studies of teacher development in mathematics.  These tools integrate four key components: (a) the development of statistical estimators to direct the design of observational and experimental multisite studies of mediation, (b) the development of an empirical basis from which to operationalize these strategies for a rich array of teacher development processes, (c) the development of free and accessible software to implement these results, and (d) the development of training materials to improve the capacity of the field.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a framework to direct the effective and efficient design of multisite mediation studies of teacher development in mathematics.  A suite of tools--statistical, empirical, software, and training--will be developed to prospectively design and implement multisite mediation teacher development studies so that they are positioned to produce effective, efficient, and comprehensive evidence. The work partitions into three components.  The first component aims to develop the statistical theory underlying the effective and efficient design of multisite mediation studies and has four objectives: (a) derive statistical power estimators for multisite mediation in observational and experimental designs, (b) extend these formulas to accommodate moderators of the mediation processes (under heterogeneous teacher development processes), (c) extend these formulas to include covariates, and (d) derive formulas to identify the optimal (most powerful) sampling plans given constraints.  The second component will apply the resulting statistical theory to the study of teacher development in mathematics.  The project intends to develop empirical estimates of the parameters needed to design teacher development studies by conducting a meta-analysis on a rich array of teacher attributes and mediators in mathematics education.  Specifically, the project plans to develop (a) empirical estimates of the necessary parameters for numerous teacher and student variables and (b) empirically-based guidelines and strategies for improving the efficacy of multisite teacher development studies.  The final component is the development of software to carry out the above formulas and calculations using free and user-friendly software and workshops to train a broad range of researchers.  Ultimately, this project seeks to improve the scope and quality of evidence produced by mediation studies of teacher development.  The core platform is intended to be transferable to other STEM education areas and STEM disciplines.  Moreover, the software and workshops developed in this project are intended to be used to distribute the results in an accessible manner to broad and diverse sets of research and practitioner groups across STEM education areas and STEM disciplines.  Thus, this project has the potential to substantially expand the scope and quality of evidence generated through mathematics teacher development studies and, more generally, multisite mediation studies throughout STEM areas.  This potential exists as this work increases researchers' capacity to design effective, efficient, and comprehensive studies.

Yet the barriers to success these groups face are often not adequately addressed by traditional methods of mentoring and professionalization in science. Minority-serving institutions are uniquely poised to foster diverse science leaders, but they also require a systematic, integrated, program-wide approach geared toward nurturing and validating students' identities as scientists. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Texas San Antonio cultivates science identity by integrating holistic mentoring with systematic training in science writing and public science communication. This program will test an innovative and potentially transformative model for diversifying science that engages both faculty and graduate students from the department of Environmental Science and Ecology in a community-supported, holistic, and systematic approach. The project will utilize a series of graduate courses, professional workshops, and community-based activities that seek to foster and validate underrepresented minority students' science identity. Nationally, these interventions may exist informally, but they are rarely, if ever, fully integrated into a coherent graduate STEM program. Developing diverse leaders in science professions is crucial as scientists navigate interdisciplinary knowledge demands and cultural challenges in a globalized and media-saturated world. <br/><br/>The goal of this IGE project is to cultivate a science identity for underrepresented minority graduate students through the acquisition of a knowledge base (competence), the ability to perform science practices (performance), and the acknowledgement by significant others in the field (recognition). The researchers propose that fostering these identity components and making them visible in scientific disciplines and public communities can be achieved through three interrelated interventions: holistic mentoring, writing-to-learn science, and public science communication. Holistic mentoring, both in and outside the classroom environment will provide the underlying framework necessary to address the needs and challenges faced by underrepresented minority students. In addition, this project hypothesizes that holistic mentoring transforms the challenges of systematic training in research-based science writing and public science communication into opportunities to validate students' scientific competence and leadership skills. The project will use a mixed-methods assessment approach to analyze not only each intervention but also on the relationships among all three interventions. Therefore, it seeks to provide an evidence-based validation of the impact of holistic mentoring and systematic communications training on cultivating a scientific ethos for underrepresented minority graduate students. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

In order to prepare students to transfer their classroom experiences to professional practice, engineering education needs to improve students? ability to work in multidisciplinary teams, deal with diverse opinions, ideas, and backgrounds, and broaden their education to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global context. This project adopts a highly developed theoretical framework called ?communities of practice? (CoP) and applies, researches, and further extends CoP theory in graduate classes across Civil Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. This approach has a strong emphasis on collaboration, teamwork, knowledge as doing, and communication across disciplinary and cultural backgrounds. <br/><br/>By applying this approach in three engineering courses from three different engineering departments at North Carolina State University, this project will yield insights around student interactions and learning within different team settings: 1) integration into a professional engineering environment, studying how students interact with professionals and how the academic and professional communities learn from their encounters; 2) engagement in interdisciplinary projects in teams that bring together two disciplinary communities; and 3) engagement in interdisciplinary projects with teams that work on subsystems which need to be integrated into one working whole. This project will focus on how diversity plays out in CoPs, examine what factors lead to productive participation by all, what challenges inhibit participation and investigate approaches to structuring academic CoPs to support equitable learning and contributions by all. Through this approach which involves various settings and granularities in three different courses, this project will develop a broader view of how engineering students learn in different team settings. The proposed approach can help to bridge the gap between theory and practice, facilitating the development of a workforce that can work within and across teams, projects, and domains.

The project team's underlying premise is that if soon-to-be teachers (re)learn core physics concepts more deeply, they will be empowered to provide richer learning opportunities for their students.  This project will provide pre-service elementary school teachers access to ideas (in physics) and tools (technological and pedagogical) with the potential to influence how they approach the teaching of basic physics concepts in the elementary grades, as their students are just entering the STEM pipeline. <br/><br/>This project targets two intertwined focal areas of the EHR Core Research (ECR) program: STEM workforce development and STEM learning and learning environments.  Building upon prior work involving HESSs, this project will work with undergraduate pre-service elementary school teachers to examine implications for the use of HESSs during their preparation. The project team will investigate pre-service elementary school teachers' understandings of forces as interactions (a foundational concept in physics) and the influence of haptic force-feedback technology.  The project adopts an embodied cognition perspective in the design, building, and testing of its intervention.  It uses a mixed-methods approach to examine the interfaces between teaching and learning and the mediation of STEM learning through fundamental use-inspired research.  The design, develop, and testing research cycle will include focus groups, usability testing, and small-scale pilot testing.  The pilot testing will use a pretest-posttest control group design with random assignment into two groups, haptic vs. non-haptic simulations.  This research has the potential to provide foundational knowledge for a new model of teaching about core physics concepts in the form of HESSs.  Project goals are to (1) add foundational human-computer interaction knowledge to guide the design, development, and testing of HESSs, (2) isolate and document the haptic influences on the development of teachers' specialized content knowledge of forces as interactions, and (3) study the pedagogical impact of the HESSs on pre-service elementary school teachers.  In addition to the benefits to the pre-service elementary teachers who participate, this project will train graduate research assistants and involve undergraduate students in cutting-edge STEM research, which also has the potential to contribute to STEM workforce development.  Project findings will be used to develop a set of design guidelines for the haptic-augmentation of science simulations that can be used by other researchers.  Moreover, cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary partnerships, such as this project, may enhance the infrastructure for STEM education and research.  This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental research in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet past experience suggests that paths from technological innovation to improved sustainability and productivity entail considerable complexity and uncertainty. Meeting challenges of improving food, energy and water (FEW) systems requires the integration of knowledge from a number of natural sciences as well as from social, political, and ethical domains. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to North Carolina State University will provide graduate students who are enrolled in diverse natural and social science masters and PhD programs with the interdisciplinary knowledge and approaches needed to help forge futures where agricultural biotechnology applications enhance FEW systems while minimizing unintended consequences. In all, the AgBioFEWS program will train at least sixty-two (62) masters and PhD students, including twenty-two (22) funded PhD students, from biological, agricultural, and social sciences. The traineeship program will partner with two historically black universities, offering internships to their students, and will establish a path for these students to join the NRT program. Continuous interaction with experts from industry, government, and non-profit agencies will expose students to diverse career paths. <br/><br/>For a new generation of students to contribute to development and utilization of agricultural biotechnology in ways that enhance FEW systems, they must be able to integrate knowledge and uncertainties from diverse, sophisticated fields of study; understand how facts and values influence decision-making; and establish their trustworthiness through evidence-based engagement with diverse communities. Tapping into North Carolina State's extension network, AgBioFEWS trainees will begin their programs living together in a small farming community situated in an ecologically fragile landscape. They will receive hands-on learning from farmers, extension agents, conservationists, and other public stakeholders in rural North Carolina. This experience is also designed to build team cohesiveness. Subsequent coursework and activities will expand student perspectives on agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems to national and international scales. AgBioFEWS course offerings will be integrated into an established graduate minor in Genetic Engineering and Society and an emerging minor in Public Science. The courses will address techniques of genetic engineering, agriculture, policy analysis, science communication, and other topics needed to prepare students for careers in government, industry, international development, and academia. All AgBioFEWS trainees will participate in an interdisciplinary team project under the direction of 2-3 faculty members, and doctoral trainees are expected to incorporate interdisciplinary agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems into their dissertations. Major research efforts range from investigating the impact of current biotechnology products on FEW socio-ecological systems to the development of potential future products. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

However, these graduates have limited knowledge as to how to translate those skills into approaches highly valued by companies, such as market evaluation, project management, product development, and finance. Given that an ever-increasing number of graduate students are pursuing employment in industry, the NC State Graduate School recently piloted a module-based training approach (Accelerate to Industry) with professional development opportunities that specifically address the transition from academia to industry. Training goals include developing graduate students' career awareness and exploration, entrepreneurial skills, ability to complete real-world work experiences, and, ultimately, career success in industry. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to North Carolina State University will allow broader testing of the Accelerate to Industry approach at diverse institutions. To expand to other universities, the project created scalable, modular activities intended to allow universities to implement the components that best fit their needs and resources. In addition, this project will establish a two-day train-the-trainer event for 10 new institutional partners annually that will focus specifically on providing graduate students with an immersive, industry-intensive learning experience. By implementing Accelerate to Industry within diverse institutions, the project will test the robustness and efficacy of the overall approach, the modular platform, and the professional development content. While mixed method assessment tools will address these broader questions, the most intensive cross-institutional assessment efforts will focus on delivery of the module from the train-the-trainers workshop that provides students with a week-long, industry-intensive immersive learning experience. If successful, this approach could provide a path forward for institutions to facilitate the successful transition of graduate students from academia to industry, and the study results will add to our understanding of best practices to support diverse career pathways for the nation's graduate population.<br/><br/>This graduate education research project will test and validate the Accelerate to Industry (A2i) approach at 30 universities representing Research 1, Research 2, and Masters-Intensive institutions. The range of institutional types will generate the data necessary to evaluate broader implementation and customization. The research is intended to advance academic knowledge in three areas: (1) the employment success derived from training STEM graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, across a variety of academic institutions through university-industry consortia; (2) the impact on employability through increased industry-relevant experiential learning, including interdisciplinary project-based experiences framed by Adult Learning Theory; and (3) the impact of facilitating industry workforce training through central administrative units (e.g., graduate schools), in contrast to more decentralized approaches (i.e., department or academic college level). Accordingly, this project will test four central hypotheses: (1) A2i participants will have increased employment and career success in industry tied to the skill development and interdisciplinary interactions offered by A2i as compared to those with no training; (2) given its flexibility and modular structure, A2i can be effectively developed in a range of different academic settings; (3) student participants value the programming afforded by A2i and feel more confident about their ability to succeed in industry; and (4) self-awareness of skills, interests, and values enhances A2i participants' learning and employment outcomes.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

A preliminary study shows that undergraduates who complete Introductory Biology I later in their college career earn lower grades and are more likely to fail than students who complete the course within their first year. The goal of this project is to identify motivational and academic factors that drive performance among first-year and upper-level students in introductory biology. The project will involve analysis of structured interviews and the development and implementation of a comprehensive survey to assess students? attitudes and beliefs about introductory biology. Ultimately, this work will inform approaches that foster success of all students in introductory coursework. Moreover, the project might identify interventions that could reduce achievement gaps among student groups, including those historically marginalized in STEM fields.

However, recent research has demonstrated that AI techniques can be manipulated, evaded, and misled. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of AI techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. This project will address this important issue by designing and implementing a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds. The approach will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. This project has the ability to transform education at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI/ML; shed light on explainable AI in cybersecurity; and grow a cybersecurity workforce that possesses AI competencies. Products, including the research findings and curriculum, will be disseminated through a variety of mechanisms, such as workshops, peer-reviewed conferences, and journals. <br/><br/>This project builds research and education capacity through the formation of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics. The team will systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, an immersive learning environment will be developed to motivate students to explore AI/ML development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. The proposed learning environment enables an AI/ML mechanism that will provide personalized explanations on the AI/ML outputs by considering the distinct background knowledge of the individual learners. Second, the team will design a proactive education paradigm encourages students to collaboratively identify new AI/ML-specific threats in the cybersecurity domain and develop innovative and trustworthy AI/ML solutions. The learning paradigm will ultimately enable effective retention and transfer of multidisciplinary AI-cybersecurity knowledge.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

Social engineering, while contributing to the majority of cyberattacks, poses a uniquely difficult problem in cybersecurity because of a combination of factors. First, social engineering is low cost and involves multiple increasingly complex and subtle attack models. Second, the majority of computer users are not cybersecurity-literate, with less than 30% judged competent on basic knowledge. Third, social engineering takes advantage of human vulnerabilities such as habit formation and susceptibility to persuasive techniques. This all results in a significant gap in security because individuals are unprepared to counteract social engineering. To address the need to educate casual computer users against social engineering attacks, this project proposes a novel approach that will take advantage of human psychology, just like the attacks themselves do. The project team proposes to create an accessible and engaging learning experience that will promote changes in attitude and behavior in computer users  by teaching them about social engineering techniques and how to detect them. This project fills an important gap by focusing on users normally marginalized by current cybersecurity education efforts, including casual computer users or  those with computer anxiety, such as the elderly and low-income families.<br/><br/>To address the dual problems of a lack of cybersecurity literacy and increasing social engineering attacks, the multidisciplinary project team proposes to integrate AI techniques to create a customized social engineering education experience that utilizes the principles of entertainment education. This effort will target non-security professionals and will use pretext design maps to train AI systems to generate social engineering scenarios.  Transformer-based natural language processing models and humor theory knowledge will be used to generate explainable humorous training schemas based on these social engineering scenarios. The scenarios will then be applied in a classroom setting, where learning patterns and specific psychological markers will be used to refine the AI-generated scenarios. The combination of these approaches will result in an effective cybersecurity pedagogical tool, powered by AI, for casual computer users.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

There is compelling evidence that creativity training can stimulate both scientific creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration, but to date, little attention has been given to creativity training in STEM graduate education. This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Georgia will bring a diverse group of graduate students together from STEM and arts disciplines to address issues in the local watershed using creativity-based training methods from the arts. This project will investigate the impact of targeted creativity training on the ability of STEM students to frame problems in new ways and help diverse teams solve complex problems. If successful, widespread adoption of these methods will contribute to equipping STEM graduates across the country with communication and collaboration skills and ultimately increase creative and innovative solutions to complex global environmental challenges.<br/><br/>Over each of five semesters, this project will recruit a cohort of ten students in the early stages of graduate study, five from STEM disciplines who self-identify as interested in environmental science, and five from arts disciplines. Cohorts will meet for six workshops facilitated by two faculty members from STEM and arts disciplines. Workshops are designed to build core creative competencies and develop skills for collaborative interdisciplinary practice. Students will gain practical experience sharing disciplinary viewpoints, creating analogies from scientific concepts, and developing collaborative frameworks for complex problem solving. The final workshop will result in a set of proposed solutions to a local watershed problem, collaboratively identified by students and stakeholders. Complementary quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to examine students' abilities to shift thinking (increase ""cognitive flexibility""), generate novel ideas, and effectively communicate and collaborate with one another. This project seeks to fundamentally enhance how STEM students are educated by engaging them in creative processes related to their research topics. Successful elements will be incorporated into a scalable training model that will be widely disseminated and available for adoption at other institutions.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

Nearly 70% of U.S. organizations experienced SE in 2017, resulting in a $2.76 million loss in operational downtime and revenues. The human factor is often regarded as the weakest link in cyberattacks, making SE a major concern for cybersecurity. Despite the significant threat posed by SE attacks, education, training and general awareness of SE as a tool for cybercrime is low. This is because SE is considered to be outside the scope of the technical domain and thus should be addressed by other disciplines, including psychology, criminology, and sociology. The engineering and computer science disciplines are already investing heavily in cybersecurity education programs that have a primarily technical focus. While this technical approach is important, the resulting pool of students is too small and homogeneous to support the holistic development of the solutions needed by our technologically dependent society. Enlarging and diversifying the pool of students learning about (and teachers educating on) SE will cast a wider net to recruit the most talented students as well as fostering their creative potential as they enter the cybersecurity workforce. Furthermore, the project will reflect the National Science Foundation?s commitment to broadening participation along two fronts identified in its Strategic Plan: (i) Expanding efforts to broaden participation from underrepresented groups and diverse institutions across all geographical regions, and (ii) Preparing a diverse and engaged STEM workforce. Thus, this project will promote diversity, and develop and share resources and sustainable tools for future SE education and research in a safe, ethical, and engaging learning environment.<br/><br/>This project has three objectives. First, it will educate students via hands-on course projects and a yearly intercollegiate SE Capture the Flag competition and training event. Second, the project will educate educators by hosting online and in-person training workshops across multiple STEM disciplines. Finally, the project will disseminate free resources such as SE course projects, datasets and analytic frameworks for research and education. The project will also develop a new set of assessment tools (surveys and focus groups) with the Center for the Advancement of Teaching to measure student and educator learning specific to SE.

Given the lack of a sufficient number of developers, the computing industry is turning to smart fuzzing and symbolic execution tools that automatically discover and patch vulnerabilities in computing systems.  While these techniques are becoming widely used in industry, few academic programs include these concepts in their educational programs.  The project will develop curricular materials that will teach students these emerging techniques that are revolutionizing how software is being tested and validated.  This project will develop open-source curricula, and hands-on, ""capture-the-flag"" (CTF) exercises that will enable Computer Science programs across the country to teach these techniques to students. <br/> <br/>In order to help develop abilities in fuzzing the project will develop a polymorphically generated web application that includes source code and several vulnerabilities.  Students will use a fuzzer to identify, and fix the vulnerabilities.  As a result students will develop the skills required to use fuzzers, and the ability to spot the errors and vulnerabilities in source-code that fuzzers reveal.  By building and publishing these educational artifacts, this project will place these tools in the hands of as many students as possible so that industry can efficiently build and secure software.  As a result, the next-generation of developers will understand the fundamental ideas behind automated vulnerability detection and correction, and develop the ability to leverage modern software testing tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is partially due to the lack of instruments and technology that can directly measure natural human interactions.  The proposed project intends to develop a dyadic functional magnetic resonance imaging (dfMRI) system to directly observe the brains of pairs of individuals while they are interacting with each other visually and by touch.  The project also hopes to develop a computer model to quantify these interactions.  Developing this technology will improve the level of knowledge about how brains work in complex environments.  Findings from this project will serve the national interest by assisting in the design of social robots, which will interact more naturally with humans.  Project findings may also help in identifying the neural underpinnings of mental disorders, particularly those that affect communication.<br/><br/>This project will leverage a pioneering dfMRI technology and methodology that can simultaneously scan two people in one commercial MRI scanner, and has generated successful feasibility tests in observing and analyzing brain-to-brain coupling in live face-to-face communication.  The first aim will be to develop a state-of-the-art dfMRI technology that will significantly improve temporal resolution and imaging quality by implementing local static magnetic field shimming and parallel imaging.  The second aim will be to use the new system to address two fundamental hypotheses in brain-to-brain interactions: (1) Face-to-face communication (measured by dfMRI) recruits more brain faculty that the Internet-based communications (measured by MR hyperscanning); therefore, it conveys more social and affective information. (2) A multi-channel cerebral network model - derived from dfMRI data - may be trained to deduce some basic social attribution processes in dyadic interaction; thus, a causal relationship between social behaviors and brain network can be identified.

The aim of the Opening Doors project is to engage industry professionals in the fields of cybersecurity and AI in conversations with educational researchers, AI and cybersecurity researchers, and K-12 teachers. These conversations will serve as a means to identify disciplinary knowledge, including needs and benefits, at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI. The group will work to identify ways to engage middle school students and their teachers in learning about AI, cybersecurity, and the intersections between them. By including this array of voices, the project will generate knowledge about the differences and similarities between industry and academic expectations. The discussion will also drive the development of a survey that can be used to determine what students know about AI and cybersecurity as well as a proof-of-concept instructional module that addresses one of the identified gaps in knowledge. The project team will also document the process for building this interdisciplinary community of practice to focus on a single issue in ways that shape students? educational experiences. The project will determine whether investing effort into deciphering what middle school students do know, and what they can know, will lead to students who are more engaged in cybersecurity and AI as citizens, users, programmers, or in other roles as they mature into adulthood.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this project will advance understanding of the nature of expertise of researchers and professionals in AI and cybersecurity, as well as supporting and studying communication between them, while exploring ways to translate that expertise into curricula for widespread dissemination to middle school teachers and students. The project team will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to accomplish the following outcomes: (1) the development of an interdisciplinary think tank along with a documented process for creating it that can inform others interested in building similar partnerships; (2) the development of survey instruments designed to uncover what middle grades students understand about AI, cybersecurity, and the intersection of these two areas as they affect their lives, as well as possible careers available in this interdisciplinary space; (3) findings from the survey on possible gaps as well as what middle grades students understand about these areas; and (4) one proof-of-concept learning module that can be implemented by any middle school teacher anywhere. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

While some available cybersecurity jobs can be filled with high school graduates and community college graduates, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the ""typical"" degree requirement for these jobs is a bachelor's degree.  Given the ability of community colleges to attract and serve disadvantaged and minority students, in order to more fully attract these students into the ""typical"" cybersecurity job, it is important that pathways between community colleges and higher education institutions be created. In addition to the pathways, activities connecting cybersecurity community college students and university students are needed.  Common issues that community college students face (including cybersecurity students) as they transfer to four year institutions are credits not transferring, the lack of preparation in theoretical foundation within the discipline, and isolation at the four-year university.  Intentional programming and coordinated efforts between faculty from the multiple institutions that students attend can help to address these issues. Because many cybersecurity community college programs are offered as applied degrees that do not easily transfer into upper level university programs, an opportunity exists to connect these community college programs with interdisciplinary bachelor's degree programs at universities.

Integrating AI into cybersecurity curricula is increasingly necessary to better prepare the future cyber workforce but is also a serious challenge. AI and cybersecurity are each difficult areas of study, appeal to different types of students, and individually require significant commitments within a fixed number of credit hours. Moreover, these challenges pose further barriers for minoritized groups (e.g., Hispanics), many of whom are already on the wrong side of the ""digital divide"". This EAGER project proposes to address the following questions: how can AI be integrated into an already packed cybersecurity curriculum, and how can this be done without further disadvantaging minoritized groups? Although this project will focus on minoritized groups, the educational modules will be designed to be culturally mindful and inclusive of a broader population and therefore will extend the project?s impact to any potential computer scientist who does not conform to the stereotypes and normative expectations of the field. The results of this study have the potential to expand and redefine who pursues cybersecurity, as well as how we integrate it into the curriculum. <br/><br/>This EAGER project will pursue three thrusts designed to address the difficult problem of integrating AI effectively into cybersecurity curricula while attending carefully to the effect of these integrations on minoritized groups, focusing specifically on Hispanic students.  First, the project team will design highly adaptable AI curricular modules that can easily be leveraged by non-AI cybersecurity educators and inserted into existing cybersecurity courses, with each module associated with a suite of potential insertion points. Second, these modules will include machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). Topics such as NLP have been shown to increase the appeal of computer science for diverse populations. Last, the project team will evaluate the effectiveness of these modules at the curriculum-level within existing cybersecurity programs that serve a diverse population.  The specific research questions to be addressed will include: (1) How did instructors perceive the content?s efficacy? (2) What factors influence an instructor's participation in curricular change? (3) What are the obstacles or considerations for AI integration into cybersecurity curricula? (4) How do students perceive content efficacy? (5) What (if any) influence do the modules have on interest, engagement, and identity? This project answers the call for advances in education research at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI through a fully interdependent and integrated approach that draws on the expertise of the team.  It also leverages widely accepted theoretical frameworks and methods to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of the work to ensure high impact and potential for future scale-up.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

Different individuals experience the same events in vastly different ways, owing to their unique histories and psychological dispositions. For someone with social anxieties, the mere thought of leaving the home can induce a feeling of panic. Conversely, an experienced mountaineer may feel quite comfortable balancing on the edge of a cliff. This variation of perspectives is captured by the term subjective experience. Despite its centrality and ubiquity in human cognition, it remains unclear how to model the neural bases of subjective experience. The proposed work will develop new techniques for statistical modeling of individual variation and apply these techniques to a neuroimaging study of the subjective experience of fear. Together, these two lines of research will yield fundamental insights into the neural bases of fear experience. More generally, the developed computational framework will provide a means of comparing different mathematical hypotheses about the relationship between neural activity and individual differences. This will enable investigation of a broad range of phenomena in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The work has further implications for other fields in which there are individual differences in subject experience, such behavioral medicine and the study of stress in the workplace or STEM education and the study of math or test anxiety. This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE). <br/><br/>The project will develop a new computational framework for modeling individual variation in neuroimaging data and use this framework to investigate the neural bases of one powerful and societally meaningful subjective experience, namely, of fear. Fear is a particularly useful assay because it involves variation across situational contexts (spiders, heights, and social situations), and dispositions (arachnophobia, acrophobia, and agoraphobia) that combine to create subjective experience. In the proposed neuroimaging study, participants will be scanned while watching videos that induce varying levels of arousal. To characterize individual variation in this neuroimaging data, the investigators will leverage advances in deep probabilistic programming to develop probabilistic variants of factor analysis models. These models infer a low-dimensional feature vector, also known as an embedding, for each participant and stimulus. A simple neural network models the relationship between embeddings and the neural response. This network can be trained in a data-driven manner and can be parameterized in a variety of ways, depending on the experimental design, or the neurocognitive hypotheses that are to be incorporated into the model. This provides the necessary infrastructure to test different neural models of fear. Concretely, the investigators will compare a model in which fear has its own unique circuit (i.e., neural signature or biomarker) to subject- or situation-specific neural architectures. More generally, the developed framework can be adapted to model individual variation in neuroimaging studies in other experimental settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FEW systems are tightly intertwined and involve complex tradeoffs that are not well understood. Characterizing the demands for and tradeoffs amongst FEW resources is particularly challenging in semi-arid regions, where increasing population trends are likely to continue, and water shortage poses risks to agriculture and energy industries.  To develop appropriate technologies and to enhance FEW system management, the next generation of analysts and researchers must be trained to develop a system-level understanding of FEW issues.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Colorado State University will address this need by undertaking research and training focused on FEW systems in semi-arid regions.  The project will prepare a diverse cohort of graduate students with the transdisciplinary skills and knowledge necessary to make meaningful contributions to the complex and changing interactions in FEW systems. The project anticipates training thirty-four (34) PhD students, including sixteen (16) funded trainees.  To foster interdisciplinary interactions, trainees will come from a broad range of disciplines including engineering, economics, natural resource sciences, and sociology.<br/><br/>The Interdisciplinary Training, Education and Research in Food-Energy-Water Systems (InTERFEWS) project addresses issues in science, technology, engineering, and math education, such as lack of capacity to provide students with skills to solve complex problems and work across disciplines.

This is a major concern because irrigated farms contribute to approximately half of US crop sales, greater crop yields, reduced poverty, affordable food, and positive health and nutrition outcomes.  Water conservation alone is not enough.  Unconventional water resources must be used, but the overwhelming barrier is energy cost. The energy sector is undergoing a significant transformation as a result of the incorporation of renewable wind and solar energy. There is an opportunity of increasingly available renewable energy to provide inexpensive and plentiful water for water-stressed agricultural lands.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Texas at Austin will train a new generation of students to develop transformative and globally relevant solutions to use unconventional water resources for agriculture by harnessing power from renewable energy and recovering energy-containing resources from ""dirty"" water.  Technical skills alone are insufficient to advance these efforts, so trainees will be taught to think critically, understand technical, financial and societal challenges to technology implementation, and communicate complex ideas freely, and at the appropriate level, with stakeholders from all walks of life. The project anticipates training a diverse cohort of thirty-six (36) MS and PhD students, including eighteen (18) funded trainees, from engineering, geosciences, and public affairs.  <br/><br/>Project goals are to develop and institutionalize a new model in STEM education that directly supports and informs research activities, professional development, and societal improvement; to develop transformative water solutions for agriculture through interdisciplinary research; and to enhance graduate student and workforce diversity.  The new educational model consists of five program elements: (1) four core courses plus a food-energy-water systems (FEWS) seminar, (2) personalized professional development activities in communication, management, entrepreneurship, and job preparation, (3) dual-faculty and alumni mentoring of trainees, (4) FEWS-relevant internships, and (5) local public service. The courses and seminar will be institutionalized through a new FEWS certificate program, and the professional development activities will become a permanent institutional element through a portfolio program. A key novelty of the traineeship is complementing classroom knowledge with experiential learning through internship and public service.  The research effort will advance disruptive technology development in new materials, water treatment processes, and renewable energy sources; decision support modeling for integration of energy and water treatment processes; and global assessment of policy and technology diffusion.  Diversity will be enhanced by outreach and recruiting at four minority-serving institutions in Texas, and through direct collaboration with Prairie View A&M University, where trainees will engage with faculty and undergraduates to do field work in sustainable agriculture.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Students have primarily been prepared for academic career paths although a significant proportion of STEM graduate students go on to non-academic careers. Therefore, it is vital to focus graduate education efforts on preparing a new type of scholar - one with a strong professional identity and a flexible set of tools - rather than preparing a person for a specific type of career. Although often neglected in traditional graduate education, the development of a student's professional identity is proven to raise retention rates and promote academic success, particularly for underrepresented students. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Boise State University will test an educational model that supports the cultivation of STEM graduate students' professional identities through collaboration with undergraduate education majors and elementary students in STEM learning. The teaching and communication skills that graduate students develop through the project will be transferable to diverse career paths.<br/><br/>GIFT (Graduate Identity Formation through Teaching) focuses on the promotion of graduate student professional identity via the concept of disciplinary stewardship, wherein professionals learn not only the knowledge and skills of their discipline, but also how their discipline connects to and serves society as a whole. Through a one credit hour course, graduate students will develop a deeper understanding of pedagogy, as well as issues related to teaching and learning. The graduate students simultaneously serve as disciplinary experts as they teach elementary teacher candidates specific topics related to the Next Generation Science Standards. The teacher candidates subsequently turn this knowledge into 15-minute mini-lessons for elementary students at a local Title I school. Based on interdisciplinary collaborations with four STEM departments at Boise State, spread over six semesters, it is anticipated that this effort will provide a transferable, low/no-cost model for future interventions that support graduate students more broadly. A comprehensive, longitudinal research plan employing both quantitative and qualitative data will enable analysis of the intervention with respect to: graduate student professional identity development, including variability across student demographics/attributes; graduate faculty advisors' attitudes/outlooks on the purposes of graduate education; and the impact of the academic disciplinary context/setting on the design of the intervention, and hence its scalability and transferability.

Yet, recent data indicate that almost two-thirds of tested students, including many students with dyslexia, do not possess the fundamental skills that are required to successfully master college-level reading material. Prosody, defined as linguistically relevant fluctuations in intonation, stress and timing, is an essential but underappreciated aspect of spoken language and reading. Humans vary in their sensitivity to the prosodic structure of speech, and there appears to be a strong link to individual differences in reading skills. With the support of the Integrative Strategies in Neural and Cognitive Systems program, this project will take bold steps towards investigating the biology and function of prosody with a creative array of approaches and research settings. With the first-ever dataset of its kind, the project intends to make critical progress towards integrating knowledge from a large population sample about the neurobiological basis of prosody across methods and levels (genetics, neuroimaging, and behavioral task performance). Beyond scientific advancement, the activities outlined in the proposed project will allow the research team to contribute to improving STEM education and educator development, addressing neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia, increasing public engagement with science and technology, and enhancing big-data partnerships across academic sites.<br/><br/>The underlying biology of prosody is poorly understood at the neural and genetic level, despite its important function in humans' communication skills. Innovative combinations of multi-disciplinary approaches for novel data collection in large samples and use of existing large-scale resources are needed to yield significant knowledge of the biology and function of prosody. The first aim of this proposal will include a series of studies using a combination of EEG, eye tracking and standardized behavioral tasks to explore the time-dynamic processes of attending to prosodic cues in ecologically valid situations of speech perception and reading, and to examine the contribution of prosody sensitivity to individual differences in reading. The second aim will be a genome-wide association study of prosodic sensitivity and will be conducted through a diverse sample of individuals recruited online throughout the United States and in-person in the Middle Tennessee area in local community and educational settings. Cutting-edge genomic methodologies (PrediXcan and Gene Set Enrichment analysis) will be used to identify the genetic markers and novel neural endophenotypes (imputed gene expression in brain tissue) that give rise to individual differences in prosody. This series of studies builds essential groundwork for future planned studies that seek to disentangle shared versus separate genetic architecture of prosody and other aspects of language function and could reveal transformative knowledge about the biological mechanisms driving individual differences in reading and language skill.

However, curricula dedicated to online fraud, including new types of fraud, are lacking from existing cybersecurity curricula. To help address the threats of cyberspace and the knowledge gaps in cybersecurity curricula, this collaborative project between Penn State University (PSU) and Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) proposes to: (1) develop a fraud informatics curriculum with three delivery options (15-week-long offline, 5-week-long online, and 1-day offline), and (2) validate the effectiveness of this curriculum and learning materials by assessing changes in participants' knowledge, skills, and behaviors.<br/><br/>This project will incorporate research-based pedagogical methods (i.e., group-based learning, context-based learning, and hands-on learning) to develop learning materials in three delivery options. The curriculum will be uniquely cohesive in its emphasis on recent online fraud and phenomena such as spam emails, social engineering attacks, astroturfing, misinformation, disinformation and data-driven solutions for detecting and preventing such frauds. The curriculum will be delivered by approximately 10 instructors to 400 undergraduate students in the Appalachian region and beyond. The goal is for the curriculum to strengthen the workforce development pipeline, and to ultimately contribute to an unrivaled, diverse cybersecurity workforce and citizenry.

Encryption is used to protect hard disk data, communication channels, and sensitive user data in large scale data centers from eavesdropping, misuse, and tampering. The use of quantum computers to carry out cyberattacks on these systems has the potential to expose a wide variety of user data  placing data worth trillions of dollars at risk.   Quantum computing courses presented in the computer science domain are typically introduced at a theoretical level with little emphasis on hands-on activities using real quantum hardware. Courses addressing quantum computing in the physics domain focus on quantum mechanical properties of materials. Meanwhile, industry is producing Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum  computers paving the way for research on practical applications of quantum computing, including using off-the-shelf algorithms to solve problems related to cryptography, which are areas not currently covered in quantum computing courses    .  As a result, there is a widening gap between coursework and industry advancement that needs to be addressed to ensure there is an adequately skilled workforce prepared to address the opportunities and threats that will arise as quantum computing becomes more widely accessible. This project hopes to address this gap and to advance cybersecurity education through the development of a flexible and portable course that can be easily adopted.<br/><br/>This project intends to create a hands-on curriculum for undergraduate students, using the Quantum Security and Trust (QUEST) framework, to allow students to apply their newly acquired knowledge immediately as part of the learning process. The proposed curriculum rests on activities and games on the QUEST framework to reinforce relevant concepts. The students will create various circuits on QUEST and validate them in simulations and on real quantum hardware. This approach should enable personalized learning at low cost due to cloud-based access to  quantum hardware and a simulator. It  also hopes to facilitate self-learning of complex quantum computing concepts through hands-on activities. The proposed course can be taken by undergraduate students with minimal prerequisite knowledge.   Therefore, a large population of undergraduate students can be exposed to quantum computing and cybersecurity early in their career. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

By partnering with a simulation software company and industry consultants, the project will generate education modules aligned with industry needs and provide novel model-based systems for engineering education. The proposal also intends to bring this technology to a variety of learners (online and residentials, graduate, four- and two-year college, and self-learners). The project goals are to address (1) the paucity of scientific evidence regarding  novel learning environments enabled by immersive simulations in STEM education and (2) the lack of evidence regarding the contribution of virtual reality (versus use of simulations on a 2D display) to STEM education. The project will help to mitigate geographical barriers that prohibit contextualized learning for students, companies? reluctance to provide access to their facilities and data, and logistical constraints that prohibit in-person site visits.

Data will be collected from students enrolled in existing online and resident courses for graduate and professional students at Pennsylvania State University. The assessment plan enables comparison of traditional vs. immersive simulation in project-based learning in resident and online delivery formats . Formative and summative assessments will be used to test the hypotheses  and investigate (1) the effectiveness  of immersive simulation PBL and how its effectiveness may vary for online vs. resident students and across graduate, professional, four-year, and two-year college levels; (2) whether the use of virtual reality alters the effectiveness of PBL via simulations for learning critical skills; (3) whether learners? demographics, personality type, prior preparation, motivation, and engineering identity can help predict learning and workplace performance using predictive analytics; and (4) the relationship between usage/navigation  and skill development using video analytics and analyses of recorded virtual site visits. By developing this environment and comparing it to in-class PBL instruction in a similar course, the researchers hope to better understand the role of virtual and immersive environments on student outcomes.

The curriculum will examine the underlying assumptions in students' research questions by drawing on the social sciences and humanities; provide support for productive collaborations; and foster interdisciplinary projects.  A broader perspective will help junior researchers better frame and initiate complex research questions, while supporting diverse researchers and projects. <br/><br/>The curricular intervention will be grounded in social scientific research that illuminates the impact of history, culture, and philosophies of science upon scientific practice.  This project will test both the impact of the content on graduate student attitudes and outcomes, as well as the delivery method.  The major research questions being addressed focus on: (1) student recognition of societal context for research (including potential bias and societal needs), (2) a culture of inclusion for those underrepresented in STEM fields, (3) interdisciplinary collaborations, and (4) the ability to accurately and appropriately use categories in research (e.g. gender, race).  A mixed-methods approach will be used to assess learning outcomes that includes pre/post attitudinal measures, focus groups, thematic analysis of student reflections, and observational data from team projects.  Given the complexity of incorporating this type of intervention across multiple STEM disciplinary areas, the project will also test the efficacy of three delivery mechanisms: (1) a ten-week seminar that will directly train two cohorts of interdisciplinary graduate students, (2) a train-the-trainer faculty education program that will measure the utility of this program in specific, disciplinary settings (Engineering and Biological Sciences), and (3) independent learning modules incorporated into programs on campus throughout the academic year.  Students who complete training will be encouraged to incorporate this knowledge into their dissertation research project.  <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.  The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed project will take important steps towards defining comprehensive curricular standards for cybersecurity education and its outcomes can potentially transform cybersecurity education in the US and internationally. The project includes the full participation of academia, government and industry stakeholders throughout the development process and in key leadership roles. It also recognizes that the development of a strong cybersecurity workforce is a global concern and the project invites global contributions to curriculum development efforts.<br/><br/>The Cyber Education Project (CEP) was started in 2014 with the dual goals of(1)establishing curricular guidelines for undergraduate cybersecurity programs that are endorsed by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society; and 2)developing discipline-specific criteria that would lead to the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) Cyber Sciences accreditation. The work to be performed through this proposal addresses mostly the first goal - it will establish curricular guidelines for cybersecurity undergraduate programs that are endorsed by major global computing associations - but it will also inform the ABET accreditation process. The activities and deliverables will include organization of the International Security Education Workshop in June 2016 and disseminating the associated workshop report; a curricular volume providing guidelines for cybersecurity undergraduate programs; and roadmaps to guide the implementation of the curricular guidance for a range of constituency groups. The project plans for broad community engagement across the range of academic constituencies - to include computing disciplines, social and behavioral science disciplines, and applied content areas. It will also provide a continuous formative assessment and adjustment throughout the curriculum development process."

Continued participation in this program will permit NSU to contribute to expanding the cybersecurity workforce, and bring cybersecurity awareness and education, not only to the NSU community, but to the general public at large. Current and past SFS scholars have worked with middle and high school cybersecurity summer camps, students in a high school cybersecurity club started by NSU and in other community cybersecurity awareness programs directed at the general public. The funding will permit NSU to continue these valuable cybersecurity awareness activities. Current SFS graduates are already contributing to the cybersecurity workforce in areas of cybercrime, digital forensics, cyber defense and in some very highly classified areas. The university is proposing to continue and expand this contribution. As a minority institution with a relatively high proportion of females pursuing Computer Science degrees, NSU will contribute substantially to addressing under-representation of minorities and females in the cybersecurity workforce. Apart from the required internship programs, SFS students are required to be a part of a cybersecurity seminar series where they are exposed to speakers from industry, current hands-on cybersecurity topics and techniques, cybersecurity certifications and preparation for cybersecurity competitions. This cybersecurity seminar enhances academic class preparation and makes these SFS graduates more competitive as they seek employment upon graduation. Through collaborations and interaction with cybersecurity employers in government agencies, NSU will continually update the academic curricula and seminar needs to ensure that graduates remain competitive not only now, but also in the future. <br/><br/>Norfolk State University's SFS program has contributed sixteen cybersecurity scholars to the cybersecurity workforce and this proposal aims to continue this work. The specific objectives are 1) recruit highly qualified and motivated individuals for workforce preparation; 2) Develop students for the cybersecurity workforce through exposure to a rigorous academic curriculum and a cybersecurity seminar series which provides additional hands-on-learning opportunities; 3) Enrich the SFS scholars and the external community by involving the SFS scholars in educating K-12 students and adults about the importance of cybersecurity and the career opportunities in the cybersecurity field. Over the course of development of the Cybersecurity program at Norfolk State University, it has developed strong relationships with the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration, The ARMY Research Laboratory, Mitre Corporation, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR). These institutions have helped to guide NSU in the preparation of students who are ready to contribute immediately upon graduation and as a result are highly sought after.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In focusing on access and equity related to internship participation, this study will be one of the first to empirically explore these issues, which are of increasing concern to higher education scholars.The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Center for College-Workforce Transitions launched a translational mixed-methods longitudinal College Internship Study in 2018 at three different types of institutions in Wisconsin and South Carolina to produce empirical evidence on student outcomes of internships. An integrative theoretical framework that views internships as a problem of situated learning as well as a venue for students' development of self-efficacy beliefs and vocational identities was used to inform the study design. The project adds six Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to this study to track a cohort of students and employers,  faculty, and career centers over three years and measure psychosocial and labor market outcomes. Additionally, the proposed research project will leverage the strengths of large-scale, generalizable survey data and the more fine-grained perspectives of qualitative data. In addition, the longitudinal aspect of the study promises to shed important light on the impacts of internship experiences on a cohort of college students over time. This study represents one of the few empirical studies examining the relationship between internships and psychosocial outcomes that are of central importance to the fields of vocational psychology and persistence and equity in STEM education. Finally, expansion of the College Internship Study to encompass HBCUs will contribute to the research on these campuses as a unique institutional context in general and to the research base on the experiences of African-American students with college climate, persistence, and career planning.  <br/><br/>The College Internship Study builds upon two bodies of literature - the learning experience as a form of situated and experiential learning and developmental processes of vocational identity. The investigators will examine what students do and under what forms of mentorship. They will use situated cognition theory to interpret these results along with Social Cognitive Career and career Construction theories from vocational psychology to conceptualize the developmental processes of interns themselves. The internship experience will be characterized as comprising three elements - participation and access, program design features, and student outcomes and experiences.  The research questions are: (1) How, if at all, does internship participation vary by students? demographics, academic programs and performance, and life/employment situations?;  (2) What, if any, are the major barriers for students to access and then persist in an internship?; (3) How, if at all, are internship program features associated with students? satisfaction, career-related self-efficacy beliefs, sense of adaptability, and employment outcomes? and (4) What are the strengths and weaknesses of institutions regarding provision of internship programs and subsequent student supports? Investigators will conduct three waves of data over three years via online student survey, student focus groups, employer interviews, and faculty/career advisor interviews across the six institutions. Using statistical and qualitative techniques, they will compile reports and interactive data and visualizations for institutional partners.  They also will use a comparative case study approach that involves situating cases within specific cultural, political, and historical contexts. The translational aspect of the project will ensure its impacts extend beyond the contribution of new scientific knowledge to policy and practice related to internship programs on participating campuses. These impacts could involve meaningful changes to students? experiences and learning, to institutional practice regarding  internship programming, and to continuous improvement efforts.<br/><br/>The project is supported by the ECR Core Research program that supports fundamental STEM education research focused on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The occasional overlap between the two fields generally takes the form of either (1) applications of ML to statistical anomaly detection (e.g., malware detection); or (2) adversarial attacks on ML detection algorithms (e.g., adversarial ML). The cybersecurity and ML fields are also rapidly advancing, which makes education both in these respective fields and at their intersection critical. Advancement and re-skilling the United States cybersecurity workforce through large-scale, online training in data-driven and ML methods is critical for keeping the country secure and the workforce competitive.   The project team will address this critical need by developing curricula for large-scale, online training of mid-career security professionals who aim to develop the skills to apply both conventional and cutting-edge ML tools to cybersecurity. <br/><br/>This project will develop curricula at the intersection of ML and cybersecurity with a focus on applications of ML to practical, real-world security use cases. In addition, the project will establish a pedagogical foundation for security researchers to evaluate and apply various potential ML-based approaches to cybersecurity. The project is  focused, in particular, on training mid-career professionals who have a classical training in cybersecurity (and thus an understanding of practical concepts), but need to gain a stronger foundation in data-driven methods that have become the basis for most applied cybersecurity in the past decade. The project outcomes will include: (1) online curricular development in data-driven security, to provide mid-career professionals foundations and practical tools for applying these methods to practical problems in network security; (2) formative research to elicit desired skills and use cases from the workforce; (3) modular public toolkits and datasets for use in both courses and as resources for professionals to apply in practical settings; and (4) augmented teaching materials, tailored to individual students, based on intelligent tutoring systems.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

A key challenge of the program is Robotics for Everyday Augmented Living (REAL), semi-automated systems that focus on tasks and work within daily life.  To make this vision a reality, important considerations include safety, adaptability to human desires, and nuanced societal impacts, such as dignity, consent, privacy, and fairness.  Traditional social sciences often study the effects of technology on individuals and society only after it is deployed.  Given the potential impact of robotics as well as the potential for unintended negative social consequences, technology should adapt to humans rather than the other way around. Current robotics training does not equip researchers with the interdisciplinary tools necessary to address this challenge.   This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Rutgers University will train a new type of professional, the socially cognizant roboticist, with the skills?in technology, social science, and public policy?needed to bridge this gap.  This training program aims to instill an awareness of human involvement into every phase of the design of new technology, so that these technologies can provide positive human value wherever they are introduced. The training program anticipates training over 35 graduate students (MS and PhD), including 17 NRT-funded trainees, by integrating technology domains (robotics, machine learning and computer vision) with social and behavioral sciences (psychology, cognitive science, and urban policy planning).<br/><br/>The program will integrate the training of technologists, who are able to develop robots that can coordinate with people, and social scientists, who can translate studies regarding the social effects of robotics into actionable lessons. Robotics is defined broadly here to include intelligent systems encompassing smart buildings and embedded infrastructure. Program participants will be trained in 1) technology: building and controlling robots, collecting, and learning from large datasets; 2) cognitive science: designing socially cognizant systems; 3) policy: assessing unintended consequences and planning for positive societal impact. The program lays the groundwork for this training via a new curriculum for a robotics specialization that combines existing technology and social science courses, as well as new interdisciplinary courses. The program will emphasize experiential learning, through the Rutgers Robotics Live Lab and interdisciplinary research projects from the partnering graduate programs, as well as internship opportunities through an Industry Consortium. Trainees will engage in fundamental research to understand and model the social dimensions of robot deployments and advance the long-term goal of dignified living and working in a technologically enhanced society.

However, there are unanswered questions relating to  trust in AI systems.  There is increasing evidence that machine learning algorithms can be maliciously manipulated to cause misclassification and false detection of objects and speech. With the growing adoption of AI-based techniques, it is therefore important to teach students the skills needed to analyze vulnerabilities in AI-based systems and how such systems may fail, as well as how to mitigate such issues to help create more trustworthy AI-based systems.  This project brings together experts from the areas of education, AI, and cybersecurity to identify challenges and potential solutions to teaching topics in trustworthy AI with the goal of evolving coursework that will appeal to, and engage, a diverse student body. It is critical to diversify the workforce operating at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI because AI-based systems can be prone to implicit vulnerabilities and blind spots due to imbalanced datasets or training methods that focus only on the overall accuracy of available datasets. <br/><br/>The project team proposes to teach and study three courses at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI, including creating a new course on trustworthy AI. Coursework will address topics that will spur students to consider how segments of the population may be differentially impacted in areas such as authentication, privacy, and user safety. Learning science and educational psychology approaches (specifically focus groups and clinical interviews) will be used to identify learning and teaching challenges and to characterize conceptions and misconceptions. The project will produce five deliverables: model curricula at the crossroads of cybersecurity and AI; strategies for managing cross-disciplinarity in such curricula; characterizations of student concepts; identification of student learning challenges; and identification of new research directions in cybersecurity and AI. The findings and curricular ideas will be disseminated broadly. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program enables trainees to generate new knowledge about objects from anthropological, biological, and geological museum collections, that will enable multidisciplinary research about how natural, physical, and human systems change through time and space. A central goal will be to understand past changes in the arid Southwestern United States through time, and how life, including diverse human communities, might respond to future changes in climate and water availability. Through research and educational activities, trainees will enhance the informational value of museum objects and collections by harnessing data science and cutting-edge techniques such as high-resolution image analysis, DNA sequencing and informatics, and elemental chemistry. This information will be intersected with data on biodiversity and social or physical systems, with the aim to describe and model biological and cultural responses to environmental and geological change in an environmentally and culturally diverse region. Working together, faculty and student research teams will address coupled human-natural impacts of climate change, water dynamics in drylands, effects of landscape transformation on ecosystem processes, and analytical linkages of object-based information with large-scale data infrastructure. This award enables education, training, and mentoring activities to recruit and train a diverse set of professionals with unique intersectional expertise, and directly supports 40 trainees at the MS and PhD levels, and extends program elements and benefits to 35 additional graduate (75 total) and 40 undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This museum-based NRT program addresses significant academic, structural, and cultural barriers that hinder cross-disciplinary initiatives in basic and applied object-based research. Ethical justification for scientific collecting and long-term support of the vast infrastructural investment that the US has made in building collections of physical materials revolves around their utility for answering scientific questions that are critical for societal well-being. Research and education activities include amplifying the information value of museum objects by linking those that share times and places into an Extended Object Network (EON). The EON framework spans across collections, incorporates biodiversity, social, and physical system databases to facilitate the description, testing, and modeling of biological and cultural responses to environmental change. The program prepares students for careers that require: (1) understanding or designing environment- or socio/economic-related research that leverages scientific collections; (2) innovative and effective use of museum resources in educational settings; (3) engaging the broader environmental research and policy community; and, (4) effectively working in collaborative teams, including development of mentoring skills. Program elements include co-mentorship in a cross-museum setting, modular courses that converge epistemological systems across disciplines, activities that provide both generalized and specialized insights into computation and data integration, and training in ethical issues affecting museums collecting and collections-based research. The geographic focus of research and training themes is the American Southwest, a region with rich cultural and natural histories and a well-known history of environmental change. Such place-based research allows trainees to dig into complex problems and is particularly effective at reaching underrepresented students because it is relevant to their own lives, experiences, and communities. Through interactions with external non-academic partners and thematically similar NRTs, this program creates pathways to several careers for trainees who have vital roles to play in science, policy, and resource management. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is important for educating a workforce that is knowledgeable about robust and trustworthy AI. The aim is to design an AI curriculum that will foster a security mindset for identifying vulnerabilities that could cause harm, whether through attacks by a malicious actor, or through perpetuating or amplifying social biases. The educational approach will focus on transparency and contextualization. Transparency involves making the inner workings of a system accessible to students, so they can understand which aspects of the system?s construction lead to its vulnerabilities. Contextualization involves situating AI techniques in real-world environments to understand their specific security implications. Contextualization is fundamental for teaching conventional security topics. For instance, accessing personal location data can serve a legitimate purpose in Google Maps, but is typically suspicious behavior in a game. The same piece of code may be used in each case, but its legitimacy is determined by its broader context. The team will conduct research on, and develop instructional materials and assessment tools for, integrating transparency and contextualization into the undergraduate AI curriculum. Since security in AI is a new area within computer science education research, the main goal is to develop initial designs for instruction and assessment that integrate transparency and contextualization at a level appropriate for undergraduates.<br/> <br/>The goal is to develop proof-of-concept instructional materials and techniques, and assessments for security concepts and skills in undergraduate AI courses. Instruction will be designed for four kinds of learning objectives. Students should: (1) know that AI systems can cause harms and are not immune to attacks; (2) be able to explain sources of vulnerabilities; (3) be able to identify vulnerabilities in a specific system, which could include attacking it; and (4) be able to defend an AI system by modifying it to mitigate threats. The team will identify AI topics in existing curricula that have security implications. The team will create tasks that illustrate the concrete security issues and conduct cognitive task analyses with experts in AI and security to see how they approach those problems. This process will yield the initial learning goals. The team will conduct an assessment survey on those goals with students who have taken the undergraduate AI course, to establish a baseline level of knowledge and elicit potential misconceptions. Based on the foundation that students have and the learning goals, the team will design initial instruction, iterating on the design through one-on-one think-alouds and small-group tutoring sessions with student participants. The team will test the instruction in a controlled experiment, comparing the AI plus security materials to AI-only materials, using pre- and post-tests to measure learning.

This MCA project embraces a transformative approach to address the critical national need for a creative professional workforce by increasing the participation of neurodiverse students in STEM disciplines.  Scientific and technological breakthroughs are crucial to address the large-scale, complex, and multifaceted challenges facing our nation. The unparalleled talents and unique abilities of neurodiverse students present a distinctive opportunity for our nation to address these difficulties. However, the excessive reliance of our STEM education on textual content and the linguistic complexities of STEM texts may disengage and discourage neurodiverse individuals, such as those with dyslexia. This project capitalizes on the unique knowledge and expertise gained from multiple previously NSF-funded projects and a strong multidisciplinary research team with expertise in neurocognitive science, neuroimaging, STEM education, dyslexia, and artificial intelligence (AI). This bold, convergent research builds on the latest advancements in AI as well as opportunities provided by neuroimaging technologies to advance a scalable, personalizable text simplification tool for middle school students with dyslexia. This project will be at the forefront of the shift towards personalized assistive tools to enhance the participation of neurodiverse students in STEM education. The project has the potential to significantly enhance the learning of middle school students with dyslexia, who despite their unique talents in spatial visualization and divergent thinking, remain highly underrepresented in STEM fields. Though this project is focused on individuals with dyslexia, the proposed framework may be further broadened to include other groups, like students with Autism, and English learners (ELs).<br/><br/>This project includes three integrated activities to advance knowledge and generate critical data for the development of a personalized assistive tool for students with dyslexia. This project aims to: 1) adapt large pretrained natural language processing (NLP) models for STEM text simplification tasks, 2) develop a large dataset of feedback from students with dyslexia and use reinforcement learning (RL) to customize the model for this population, and 3) use features of electroencephalogram (EEG) data to measure neurocognitive functions related to reading comprehension to personalize the model. The student feedback dataset and individual EEGs collected during the reading tasks may significantly benefit future research in dyslexia, neurocognitive sciences, STEM education, and machine learning. The outcomes of the study may encourage the advancement of personalized learning using brain data. The research partnership formed through this project facilitates the development of large-scale multidisciplinary studies aimed at enhancing the academic success of neurodiverse students. An industry collaborator will be involved early in the project to ensure a broad dissemination of the assistive tool and project outcomes.

Accelerating threats from climate change, habitat degradation, overexploitation, and species invasions threaten access to food, energy, water, and other ecosystem services, especially in cities. Preventing loss of critical services requires accurate predictions of these risks. To meet this demand, we will train graduate student teams to predict alternative futures and design resilient landscapes. This traineeship program will create a novel, cross-cutting framework for STEM education that combines collaborative and problem-based learning and research, while applying techniques aimed at recruiting and retaining a more diverse student cohort. Trainees will develop new skills in an immersive, team-based education model that also applies new knowledge to real-life applications. Enhanced skills in risk assessment, management, and communication will create a highly skilled workforce that can address the 21st Century threats to human life support systems. The traineeship anticipates preparing 64 Ph.D. students, including 32 funded trainees from the life sciences, engineering, geography, geosciences, natural resources, statistics, economics, and computer science. Ultimately the grant will promote the training of students for jobs as risk analysts in a range of careers, not just in academia, but also in industry, non-profit organizations, and government. <br/><br/>In a rapidly urbanizing world, society needs landscapes that are resilient to risks to food, energy, and water, and other ecosystem services (FEWES). The challenge for society is to design landscapes that provide multiple human benefits, maintain ecosystem function, and prove resilient to future risks. This project will address unresolved debates such as whether to develop land intensely, leaving more land untouched (land-sparing) or to develop land moderately, but over a wider area (land-sharing). To resolve such debates and create resilient urban-to-wild landscapes, students will learn how to apply landscape risk assessment to estimate threats, benefits, and uncertainty by exploring landscape linkages and developing scenarios that include socioeconomic impacts for tradeoffs among FEWES. This traineeship will also develop a novel, cross-cutting framework for teaching STEM education by synergistically combining collaborative, problem-based, and service-based learning to assess risks to FEWES. These practices will be combined to develop a unique approach to graduate education called Team-TERRA, or Team-based, Transdisciplinary, Estimation of Risks, and Real-world Analysis. Students will originate from different backgrounds and disciplines and will learn to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. Trainees will earn a certificate in Environmental Risk Assessment by learning how to work with stakeholders, develop quantitative analytical skills in predicting risk and uncertainty, explore options for managing such risks, and communicate risk and uncertainty to clients, stakeholders, and the public. Overall, trainees will learn transferable skills by working with real-world problems, while providing an important service to governments, NGOs, and businesses.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this model, the capstone requirement for the STEM PhD is satisfied through the publication of original research in academic journals, where the work must be evaluated favorably by experts through peer-review. In recent years, there has been an increasing participation of STEM PhDs in technology entrepreneurship, through the development of patentable technologies, and the formation of startup companies. The STEM PhD program, as it exists, does not adequately provide this growing proportion of the STEM workforce who are active in entrepreneurship with the necessary professional skills and preparation. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) will introduce a novel approach in which STEM PhD students will develop patentable technologies as the capstone requirement. These innovations will be implemented in a new program called Pathways to Entrepreneurship (PAtENT), which will provide an alternate pathway to earning a doctoral degree that has the potential to spur graduation rates, generate employment in the local communities in which it is deployed, and maintain the nation?s edge in technological innovation. <br/><br/>The central goal of the project will be to develop an alternate roadmap for STEM PhD students that is scalable and reflects the rapidly evolving workforce needs. This goal will be achieved without sacrificing the technical rigor of the traditional PhD program, by subjecting the patent applications to external peer review. An independent evaluator will collect extensive data on the efficacy of the program, and address specific objectives such as the alignment of the roadmap with the core scientific and professional elements required for a PhD, assess the scalability potential of the pilot study, develop recommendations for STEM programs at other doctoral institutions across the country, and measure the participation rates and employment outcomes of under-represented minorities targeted by the program. The evaluation will consist of a mixed-methods design that will include surveys, polls and interviews developed for current students and faculty, and reflective questions for the project leadership. The project will emphasize the recruitment of female and veteran students, groups that are currently under-represented in the technology startup workforce. If successful, the project will help modernize STEM doctoral programs to suit the needs of the country?s future as a knowledge-based economy. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

While many of the skills and competencies needed for both types of research are overlapping or complementary, graduate students may not have the opportunity to fully explore industry-related skillsets and mindsets in a traditional academic setting.  Stronger collaboration between industry and academia can bridge this gap, with most institutional approaches involving a short-term industry internship. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Lehigh University will test a graduate training model that represents a student-centered, holistic approach that gives students long-term, hands-on industry experience.  A key feature of the approach is early and sustained industry engagement, with industry partners involved in identification of the research question that forms for the basis for the student's thesis, mentoring, delivery of professional development modules, and supervision of students during a company residency (similar to medical school training).  This approach is patterned after successful programs in France, Germany and the UK, with the intent of testing the model in the United States.  It is hypothesized that the approach will train graduate students more effectively to engage in use-inspired research and prepare them with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in an industrial setting. <br/><br/>The project will pilot and test several key features of this use-inspired research training model: (a) a pre-program summer experience with a company to identify a research topic; (b) co-advisers from the university and partner company; (c) modular, graduate-level professional development co-taught by faculty and industry researchers; and (d) a one to two semester company residency. The effectiveness of these four elements will be assessed using a mixed-methods approach, with an eye toward critical student skillsets identified through a gap analysis with industry partners.  The study will use both longitudinal data from individual students as well as comparisons to non-participatory control groups.  The findings will inform our understanding of the most effective ways to experientially open industry career paths for STEM graduate students.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

Importantly, children who exhibit early lags in mathematics development may also demonstrate lower growth rates in mathematics skills later. Consequently, early gaps in mathematics skills may widen over the course of schooling. How to diagnose and correct mathematics shortcomings early is a challenge that K?12 schools must confront systematically. Unlike reading, few states currently have a coherent statewide program for early mathematics intervention. Kentucky?s Mathematics Achievement Fund (MAF)?a statewide K-3 mathematics intervention program?is a prime example of a state?s effort to intervene early on to change a student?s mathematics development trajectory. By using a quasi-experimental design with data gathered during the implementation of MAF, this study will provide valuable information on how states can structure and provide resources to support early mathematics intervention efforts. The project will connect research and practice and add much-needed information to the existing knowledge base that states can use when considering early-grade mathematics programs. The proposed project is a joint effort between the American Institutes for Research and the Kentucky Department of Education and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>Existing early-grade mathematics interventions tend to be one-off, localized efforts, usually without a coherent or sustainable strategy, and often implemented by experimenters or supported by vendors of prepackaged interventions. Interventions that show promising results are typically small-scale studies, whereas large-scale studies often find null benefits. This project is designed to examine the causal effects of MAF on student outcomes in a regression discontinuity framework. In particular, the project will use student-level administrative data and original data collected through surveys and interviews to examine the causal effects of MAF on students? academic and non-academic outcomes both immediately after the intervention and in later grades. The project will also investigate who is likely to benefit from MAF and under what conditions and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program. The project will contribute to the existing literature in several ways. First, most existing studies on early mathematics interventions focus on student outcomes at the end of the intervention. There is evidence that large, short-run effects on student scores in early grades could dissipate over time. By tracking some 3rd-grade students into high school, the project plans to examine the extent to which the short-term benefits of the MAF program, if any, persist over time. Further, the project will also explore how MAF may affect other aspects of children?s schooling experiences such as possible spillover effects of MAF on other subjects and non-test outcomes like middle school course-taking and student engagement. In this way, the proposed project seeks to catalyze new knowledge that will help inform the discussion on systematic, coherent early-grade mathematics policies at the state level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigators will investigate the upskilling/reskilling pathways into master?s education and how different motivations and other factors may explain student choices. The project also will shed light on how master?s education may facilitate transitions to STEM careers for non-STEM undergraduate majors. In addition to providing an evidence base for investments in STEM technical training, the project will contribute to developing a more comprehensive approach to improving STEM master?s education.<br/> <br/>The research design is guided by the traditional human capital investment perspective where individuals pursue master?s education to gain skills, knowledge, and expertise to increase their career effectiveness and success.  Investigators hypothesize that (1) individuals are motivated by their desires to upskill or reskill, thus making themselves more marketable in the labor market; (2) individuals? intentions to upskill or reskill and decisions to pursue particular master?s degrees will translate into their subsequent job placements and career trajectories. An exit survey of master?s degree recipients from ten U.S. colleges and universities will be used to answer three research questions: (1) What factors are associated with STEM and non-STEM students? pursuit of master?s degrees in STEM and non-STEM fields? (2) How does attainment of a master?s degree explain persistence or job changes within the STEM workforce.  (3) How does the upskilling and reskilling pathways through master?s education differ by subfields and socioeconomic attributes of master?s degree recipients? The survey will include questions from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Survey of Earned Doctorates, Council of Graduate Schools Professional Science Master?s Initiative exit survey, and alumni and student surveys from the NSF Understanding PhD Career Pathways in STEM project.

Initial qualitative interviews with four graduate school deans from diverse institutions will inform the development of the survey instrument. Using both closed- and open-ended questions, the survey will focus on impacts and innovations across three key areas of inquiry: (1) graduate student academic and research progress; (2) graduate student health and well-being; and (3) graduate program continuity and sustainability. Data analysis will include descriptive analyses and statistical tests to identify potential differences across institutional types (e.g., size, highest-degree awarded, minority serving). Qualitative data from the surveys will be coded and organized into the three key areas of inquiry. The survey results will then be shared, vetted, and further refined by a working assembly (virtual or in-person) of approximately 30 representatives from participating institutions.

The previous study results revealed a complex tapestry of experiences with mentoring, gender discrimination, and the development of career goals that influenced the students? ultimate outcomes. The study showed that many were considering non-academic careers because of their perceptions of work-life balance and the academic workplace climate. The current project will expand the previous study by interviewing the original cohort to collect pathway data that compares their careers and trajectories to their stated goals and aspirations. The  study will add a second cohort to lay the groundwork for further research that includes multiple intersectional identities that typically are omitted from physics education research. The goal is to inform interventions that may be used to recruit and retain women STEM faculty. The investigator will also implement a professional development plan to build STEM education research capacity through mentors who will provide guidance on qualitative data collection and analysis, manuscript writing, and translation of research to practice. The project is expected to expand the pool of STEM education researchers, enhance the knowledge about the role of mentoring in STEM workforce development, and reduce STEM disparities among women.<br/><br/>The study will seek to understand the longitudinal career outcomes and gendered experiences of women in physics and astronomy by investigating  the following research questions: (1)What are the differences between the career expectations of women in graduate school and their actual careers over the last ten years? (2) What role did mentorship play in their career trajectory and outcomes? and (3) What gendered experiences have they had since completing their graduate degrees?  The research questions will test the hypothesis that the career trajectories of women and people of color in physics are impacted by their identities and mentoring experiences which in turn inform their career goals and academic pathways. Framed by constructivist grounded theory and standpoint theory, the study will use an intersectional approach to employ qualitative methods to analyze data from semi-structured interviews at the University of Utah to answer the research questions. The interview protocol will be a list of themed questions that will be discussed during the conversational interviews. The methodology will not compare women to their peers, but it will yield data about their individual perspectives about their experiences.

To realize such systems requires a deep understanding of the interfaces between the cyber and physical worlds, leading to the establishment of the field of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). While CPS as a discipline and application-enabler has evolved tremendously over the past decade, current graduate training does not sufficiently prepare students for fundamental discovery and innovation in CPS nor for effective translation of research to application development. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Virginia (UVA) will address this need by training graduate students to pursue fundamental CPS discovery and innovation and to collaborate with application domain experts to realize a smarter planet, specifically in the areas of smart health, smart cities, and autonomous systems. The traineeship anticipates training one hundred fifty-eight (158) master's and doctoral students, including thirty-three (33) funded PhD trainees, from civil and environmental engineering, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, mechanical and aerospace engineering, and systems and information engineering.<br/><br/>Current CPS graduate training is lacking in three critical ways that will be addressed in this project. First, current courses do not instill the integrative knowledge needed for new scientific discovery and translational applications in the field of CPS. Second, most students do not have a sufficiently robust experience of convergence activities as part of their training. This lack exists not only in traditional engineering and computing education but also extends into analyses of target application domains and associated grand challenges. Third, explicit professional development is absent in most graduate training. Such exposure is critical in CPS given the field's potent role in our ever-evolving smart world, and CPS practitioners must attend to social issues regarding ethics, safety, privacy, communication, and policy. This traineeship will address these issues and drive CPS graduate education nationwide by developing a novel, comprehensive graduate training program that involves orientation, normalization modules, elective courses, experiential convergence research activities, professional development workshops, and a hands-on, testbed-driven educational curriculum. Students will acquire both the technical depth and the integrative transdisciplinary understanding of CPS and its associated application domains to be successful in CPS-related careers. During their time in the program, trainees will engage in transdisciplinary CPS research on projects related to challenges in smart health, smart cities, and autonomous systems.  These research efforts have the potential for significant scientific and application impact, such that a smarter world can be achieved and associated societal grand challenges can be addressed.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This traditional approach to graduate education leaves PhD students unprepared to enter the non-academic workforce upon graduation. A lack of adequate preparation not only adversely affects the students themselves, but also leads to missed opportunities for society, since STEM PhD students often have precisely the deep technical background needed to solve the growing number of data-driven problems society faces. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Duke University will test whether Master-level data science programs, which usually have curricula that emphasize the professional skills and applied data skills missing from most PhD programs, can be leveraged to improve the preparation of PhD students. This project will test the outcomes of combining the applied approach of Master-level data science programs with the depth and experience of PhD STEM students. More specifically, it will determine which aspects of Master-level professional curricula translate to PhD students. The results will provide guidance on approaches to extend the impact of a growing investment in data science Master programs to doctoral-level students and will inform the education community on better preparing the next generation of STEM scientists to work with and improve methods surrounding big data. In so doing, this project will help strengthen the pipeline between universities and non-academic employers. <br/><br/>This project will incorporate a select cohort of Duke's STEM PhD students into Duke's Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) Capstone projects with non-academic partners, and include the selected PhD students in the professional development activities of the MIDS program. Duke's MIDS program emphasizes comprehensive training in professional and communication skills in its coursework. The program culminates in a capstone project that requires students to solve a data-driven problem for a partner outside of the university. Students must apply the technical skills, theoretical knowledge, and professional skills they learned in the classroom to a real-life situation that requires interacting with a diversity of both technical and non-technical collaborators. The goal of this research is to determine which of these enhanced experiences can mitigate - and ultimately, overcome - the shortage of doctoral graduates with industry-relevant training, developed professional competencies, and deep domain knowledge. The principles guiding this IGE project stem from research on the use of vertically-integrated, topically-focused research teams as mechanisms to motivate effective, meaningful learning. The MIDS Capstone curriculum is based on evidence-backed practices from the team-based learning and service learning literature. The effectiveness of the project for STEM PhD students will be evaluated using survey, interview, and structured assessment data collected from students, faculty, and Capstone partners, as well as data from potential future employers and students' supervisors after they move to new positions. Outcomes measured will include students' professional skills, students' data science competencies, students' research accomplishments, and reported benefits to non-academic partners. The results will be used to develop scalable mechanisms for universities to extend the impact of their investment in data science Master programs to doctoral-level students. Doing so will strengthen the potential for PhD students to deploy their expertise to solve society's most pressing problems both inside and outside of academia and will provide richer opportunities for organizations to find data scientists with the specialized knowledge needed to solve problems within their area. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying assumption is that WBL might serve as an antidote to negative social and cultural messages, lack of support, lack of access to on-the-job STEM learning, and other factors that influence students' decisions to remain in STEM. The study also will contribute to career counseling research through the application of the SCCT in the community college context. <br/><br/>Researchers will use a mixed-methods research design that involves an analysis of two cohorts (recession and post-recession) using data from the Florida Education Data System (FEDS), case studies at two Florida community colleges, and transcript data for the information technology and engineering technology students enrolled at the case study schools. The study sample is expected to include a total of 8,665 community college students with 1,500 having participated in a WBL course.  Researchers will use exploratory and descriptive multivariate analysis of FEDS to answer questions about WBL participation and impact.  Case studies of WBL will be conducted at two Florida community colleges to collect data about how students learn about WBL, what influences their choice to participate in WBL, how WBL influences their self-efficacy and expectations (per SCCT), and perceptions of whether WBL improves student outcomes. In addition, they will analyze extant data from the colleges to explore the impact of WBL experiences on student completion and entrance into STEM careers and four-year STEM programs of study.  The interview sample for both colleges will include 60 students, six administrators, 24 faculty, and 48 employers. The researchers will use the data to test the best practice principles in WBL developed by Jobs for the Future as bench marks for community colleges.  The project fills a gap in the knowledge about SCCT by applying it to WBL.

The investigators will investigate questions about how dominant institutional structures afford or limit STEM learning and integration of experiences for marginalized youth and how claims of objectivity and neutrality and a culture of meritocracy in the sciences affect opportunities for such youth.  The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach to answer three research questions: (1) What factors influence commitment to, or divergence from, a pursuit of a STEM major and career? (2) How do institutions, internships, and workplaces create opportunities, experiences, and strategies for students to develop a sense of belonging or function to marginalize youth? (3) In what ways do youth experience and manage obstacles and biases, stereotypes, and microaggressions that they encounter in college, workforce preparation experiences, and first jobs?

Currently, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology graduate programs in the US lag behind other biological disciplines in the representation of PEER students (persons excluded due to ethnicity and race). This project aims to address this issue by piloting a program that aims to increase PEER recruitment, create a cohort community, improve the sense of belonging among students, increase early access to expert field methods training, and expand training to address ecological questions relevant to global environmental change. Challenging issues related to environmental change, such as biodiversity loss and climate change, require a diverse workforce of highly trained biologists who can collaborate across disciplines and produce solution-oriented scientific approaches. While our program is tailored to the disciplines of ecology and evolution, the basic elements of the program could be adapted to many STEM disciplines and broaden the impact of this approach.<br/><br/>The PIs of this project will work to increase PEER graduate student recruitment efforts through connection with multiple conferences and networks that promote student diversity. The design of the graduate education model draws on theories of human motivation and personality (self-determination theory and sources of self-efficacy) to target psychological needs that, when satisfied, foster well-being and success in graduate school: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. By providing an early immersive field experience for a cohort of students the summer before they begin graduate school, our program will work to remove the barriers that fieldwork poses to PEER students interested in ecology while providing critical early-training and cohort building to increase retention and students? success. The project will take advantage of the well-established Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research (NWT LTER) program and the Mountain Research Station at CU Boulder. Evaluation of the program will focus on understanding how programmatic components support students in developing competence in the field and analytical methods, autonomy and independence as researchers, and a sense of belonging within the field.

This project will develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled cybersecurity tool referred to as a knowledge graph (AISecKG) to address this cybersecurity education challenge. Knowledge graphs, widely used by search engines and social networks,  integrate data and can store linked descriptions of items such as objects, concepts, and events. This project applies a novel learning approach for cybersecurity education by providing university students a flexible learning plan that enhances their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This approach aims to help students understand the complex nature of cyber-attacks and defense mechanisms, provide them with a holistic view and better prepare them to address the complexities of real-world scenarios. <br/><br/>The development and deployment of AISecKG are interdisciplinary. First, the project employs machine learning (ML) and AI approaches to build a new cybersecurity knowledge graph by measuring and setting up similarities and dependencies among cybersecurity learning targets for both study planning and learning-outcome assessment. Second, it incorporates a multi-level assessment approach to design cybersecurity curricula, scaffold student cognitive engagement, and improve student learning outcomes. AISecKG has two primary design goals. First, it will guide instructors to develop a problem-based learning curriculum based on their learning objectives. Second, it will allow students to apply an adaptive learning strategy, incorporating hands-on labs to assess their learning outcomes. To assess students? learning performance quantitatively, AISecKG will (a) deploy an evidence-based model and learning materials for problem-based cybersecurity education focusing on developing teacher capacity and practice while using targeted materials and approaches; (b) produce a productive teaching model for deep learning that promotes a culture of scientific inquiry and design as well as a set of strategies to develop student competency; and (c) provide evidence of student learning outcomes as a pedagogical resource to support student cognitive engagement in learning tasks interactively. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity are, like much of computer science, extremely technical fields that continue to advance at rapid rates both in knowledge and application. Computer science often allows a small team to leverage its members' expertise through the use of plug-and-play solutions that require little or no user intervention. In contrast, it has become obvious that reliance on a limited number of highly skilled people does not work as well for cybersecurity . This inadequacy appears to be addressable through the application of AI concepts and by training individuals who are expert in both AI and cybersecurity. However, the amount of time, focus, and effort required to become highly proficient in both AI and cybersecurity fields is a significant barrier to this solution. This project strives to explore potentially transformative educational approaches in order to prepare a more robust workforce at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. Specifically, the project team proposes a collaborative, group-based, and hands-on course that combines students with a specific interest and existing background in either the AI or cybersecurity domain with students with the complementary background.  This educational approach will produce students who share   a combined AI and cybersecurity mindset.<br/><br/>The fundamental assumption of this project is that students will rarely need to apply a deep, technical understanding of the AI field within the cybersecurity domain. As such, a more viable and succinct approach to producing a workforce competent in both domains is to focus on expanding students? toolkits and providing them reference-anchors.  This approach will enable students to more efficiently collaborate with domain-specific experts and across  domain boundaries when they enter the workforce. In   order to explore this approach, the project team proposes to develop a course directed at students with backgrounds in AI or cybersecurity. The course will combine elements from problem-based learning , studio-based learning, and group-based learning.   This approach will cultivate students with a melded AI and cybersecurity mindset even though they may lack technical depth in their non-focus domain. This mindset or awareness will prepare these students to enter the workforce and collaborate across technical disciplines. While a future goal may be combined AI and cybersecurity ?natives? it is important first to evaluate the more easily attainable option of instilling technical awareness and a multi-perspective approach. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

At the same time, many of these communities - including those in Western Kansas - are facing serious challenges that threaten their survival, such as water shortages, economic pressures, and a population decline. For rural communities to adapt and thrive in a more uncertain future requires the development of new technologies and practices to enable sustainable agriculture, which in turn requires leaders who can think outside the box. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Kansas State University will prepare students to become science-based leaders and advocates for resilient rural communities by combining engineering, economics, and sociological knowledge to meet the needs of farmers, industry, and society. Students will engage with farmers, government and industry through interactive sessions and will develop relevant skills through innovative coursework and teamwork.

The interdisciplinary research efforts funded through this project will focus on resource conservation, recovery, and reuse for sustainable agriculture, including: (1) innovations for soil, water and microbial systems in the face of drought, (2) hydrologic science and water conservation systems for efficient food production, and (3) anaerobic bioreactors to transform animal waste into usable energy, water, and fertilizer. Engineering innovations alone will not bring about more resilient rural communities; it is critical that solutions also address perceptions, barriers, and attitudes among stakeholders to meet their shorter-term needs while enabling transitions to more resilient system dynamics over longer time frames. NRT training through this program will create culturally competent, interdisciplinary problem-solvers through immersive experiences with producers and industry in Southwest Kansas, policy makers in the state capital, and interdisciplinary coursework that integrates theory, practice, and international discussions. In addition, outreach to agricultural high school teachers will develop trainee leadership skills and trainee success will be supported by team-based faculty and peer mentoring.  <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Attackers can steal data-processing capacity and/or leak user data from a user's web browser, automobiles can be commandeered by violating the integrity of safety-critical software, virtual currency can be stolen by corrupting mobile games, critical infrastructure can be subverted by manipulating electrical meters, and Internet-of-Things devices in our homes can be hijacked. Reverse engineering and anti-reverse engineering are important topics in cybersecurity. Malicious actors may seek to reverse engineer software and hardware to find vulnerable points to attack. Conversely, these concepts can be used defensively by cybersecurity professionals to identify and strengthen vulnerabilities in hardware and software, and to prevent exploitation.  This project will develop a collection of educational resources for teaching reverse engineering and anti-reverse engineering concepts to undergraduate and graduate level computer science students. These resources will stress the interplay between reverse engineering and anti-reverse engineering, and how progress in one drives progress in the other. As a result of this project, computer science students will enter the workforce with a better understanding of how to defend against endpoint attacks, which will benefit national security.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is threefold: to give students the mental tools necessary to understand the low-level nature of many of the cybersecurity issues seen today, to increase student proficiency in dissecting and analyzing different forms of executable code, and to ensure students are familiar with techniques for protecting against attacks. Particular emphasis is placed on the interplay between reverse engineering and anti-reverse engineering. Over time, the design of more powerful program analysis techniques has driven the development of new software protection techniques to counter them, and vice versa. It is the goal of this work to provide students with the intellectual tools and practical skills to appreciate this ongoing struggle and to prepare them for future developments throughout their careers. To accomplish this goal, the project team proposes to develop a structure termed ""LIGERLabs"" to foster undergraduate and graduate computer science students' abilities in reverse engineering and anti-reverse engineering. LIGERLabs will include a collection of recorded video lectures and animations, virtual machines with pre-installed attack and defense tools, write-ups and answer-sheets for paper-and-pencil homework exercises and in-class collaborative exercises, take-home programming assignments, and generators and auto-graders of reverse engineering exercises.

These challenges include limited access to classrooms and labs, disruption to current and planned collaborations, increased stress and anxiety, and new responsibilities for children and other family members. This impact is particularly acute for graduate students with marginalized identities (e.g., students of color, low-income students) who are often already struggling with existing inequalities. To compound matters, these hardships confront a graduate student population that multiple studies suggest was already facing a mental health crisis. If graduate students do not feel supported during this critical period, the U.S. may suffer a dramatic decline in the effectiveness and inclusiveness of its graduate-level training, resulting in long-term negative impacts on the U.S. scientific knowledge base, society, and the broader U.S. economy. This National Science Foundation Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award to Montana State University, Iowa State University, and Texas A&M-Commerce will support research on: postsecondary institutional policies and practices that are designed to help graduate students feel supported during the COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of these efforts on graduate student educational and career decision-making. The study will contribute to a research base for graduate school administrators and faculty about how to immediately help graduate students during a crisis, as well as what strategies might be most effective for supporting graduate students in STEM fields and more broadly as they make degree and career-related decisions as society emerges from the crisis. <br/><br/>The project is a multi-institution, two-phase explanatory mixed method study of graduate students? experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, their perceptions of institutional support, and near-term impact of this support on educational and career decision-making.

Despite their importance, many river systems are highly contaminated with toxins, sediment, nutrients, and metals. Contamination originates from many sources, including industrial activity, pesticide runoff, wastewater treatment discharges, and urban runoff. This contamination is considered an invisible water crisis posing serious risks for wildlife and human health in many places. As this crisis escalates in watersheds, it impacts the communities living in these watersheds adversely. Therefore, it becomes important to train a new workforce capable of integrating scientific information, public policy, and the knowledge and concerns of affected social groups, including Native American tribes, for effective management of the resources of river systems. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Washington State University will train graduate students from across the United States how to study challenges in rivers, watersheds, and communities as they relate to human and ecosystem health and will use the Columbia River Basin as the study site. The project anticipates training 65 master?s and doctoral degree students, including 25 funded trainees, from civil and environmental engineering, biological sciences, environmental and natural resources sciences, environmental sociology, and political science. Central to the traineeship is developing a community engagement approach that begins with the recognition that communities face diverse and complex issues and leverages knowledge of native communities to identify key problems and implement equitable solutions. Students participating in this program will engage with communities to co-produce solutions and opportunities to the invisible water crisis through scientific training, research, and problem-solving. <br/><br/>This NRT program will integrate the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and traditional knowledges to develop a transdisciplinary research program in river-watershed-community systems that ultimately will produce equitable solutions to pressing, societal problems experienced by diverse communities. Program activities are focused on two education and training objectives aimed to: (1) cause a cultural shift in STEM graduate education by embracing transdisciplinary learning and the co-production of knowledge through community engagement, and (2) transform our STEM graduate training into a student-centered mentoring model.

Elements of project-based learning and action learning theories will frame the research, although much of the extant research on registered apprenticeships is either descriptive or atheoretical, or it is grounded in economic theories that are principally concerned with explaining an employer's incentive to provide apprenticeship training.  The results of the project will support the implementation and expansion of STEM apprenticeship programs and guide the design of new comparable STEM training programs. <br/><br/>The investigator will use data from the Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Data System (RAPIDS) and state data from Virginia and Washington to answer research questions investigating the characteristics of STEM apprentices and apprenticeship programs and whether they vary over time and across different fields, completion rates for STEM apprentices and determinants of program completion for these workers, and level of wage growth apprentices achieve upon completion of their apprenticeship. The analysis will be conducted in two overlapping stages. First, multivariate modeling using administrative data on registered apprenticeship will examine the prevalence of the apprenticeship training model in STEM occupations and the characteristics of apprentices in these fields. The administrative data also track apprentice outcomes, including progress through and completion of the program and wage rates for completers. These data will be used for multivariate modeling of the determinants of apprentice outcomes. The findings from the multivariate models of apprentice outcomes will inform the development of protocols for the second stage of the analysis - content analysis of apprenticeship work process schedules and interviews with representatives of STEM apprenticeship programs. The interviews will explore how apprenticeship training supports workforce development, promising strategies for STEM apprenticeships, and the strengths and weaknesses of the training model.

The first research objective is to apply the expanded LCI with seven research teams and examine differences in student outcomes (e.g., quality of research proposals, critical thinking skills, research self-efficacy, etc.) between those who participated in the LCI and a representative sample of non-LCI peers.  The second research objective is to provide mentoring training and resources through interactions among students, faculty, and relevant industry stakeholders on a regular and structured basis.  Quantitative surveys and qualitative focus groups with LCI participants will evaluate the perceived quality, characteristics of, and satisfaction with their mentoring relationships and how mentoring influenced graduate students? persistence attitudes.  Pre- and post-intervention surveys with LCI and non-LCI peers will examine students? and faculty?s sense of belonging within the research team, the academic department, and the larger field of engineering.  The third research objective is to foster the development of professional competencies and workforce readiness by helping students create an individualized career development plan including career aspirations, goals, and action steps that will be reviewed at specific time points.  Career exploration resources, as well as structured networking opportunities with professionals in the engineering-related industry, will be provided.  Pre- and post-intervention surveys with LCI and non-LCI peers will examine differences in the development of STEM core competencies as well as progress towards degree and workforce readiness indicators.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

The project intends to develop and support a series of publicly accessible AI challenge competitions aimed at facilitating the public?s understanding of AI technologies and cybersecurity. All challenges will additionally serve as large-scale data collection platforms, assisting researchers in better understanding the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI systems. Project plans include creating lesson plans and challenges designed simultaneously to broaden understanding of cybersecurity issues in AI and provide an on-ramp for students interested in AI and cybersecurity across K-12 and higher education. Overall, the project team hopes to contribute to and scale ongoing efforts to develop and administer freely available online curricula that fosters public awareness of AI.<br/><br/>There is a clear and urgent need to connect research, education, and workforce development efforts at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of AI and machine learning challenges, as well as the rapid development and adoption of AI technologies. This project will address these urgent challenges through the following research questions: First, how do individuals identify trustworthy AI systems and outputs? Second, how do AI/Cybersecurity concepts align with current educational standards? Last, how can public understanding and trust of AI be enhanced further? To answer these questions, the project will develop scaffolded challenges at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI entitled ?Deeperfakes? and ?P0150N?. The project team will work with the non-profit AI Education Project, working specifically to include modules on deep fakes and the role of AI in the cybersecurity workforce. The Deeperfakes challenges will ask participants to verify a series of AI-generated images and media, explaining their reasoning for either accepting or rejecting various media as real or fabricated. Similarly, the P0150N challenges will pit students against simple AI systems modeling those that detect denial of service attacks. This will allow students to experiment with mechanisms to poison the AI and successfully carry out an attack. The challenges will also serve as data collection tools and produce a large, open dataset for AI and cybersecurity research. This dataset will provide AI and cybersecurity researchers with information on how people read ?faked? algorithmic media as real or fabricated. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

The positive benefits of CUREs include increased analytical skills, technical skills, self-efficacy, and persistence in science. Most of the reported research on CUREs is from research-intensive institutions with selective admissions, and some CUREs have been intentionally limited to only high-achieving students. This research project will test the hypothesis that CUREs benefit students when implemented at an institution with a great diversity in student socioeconomic background and a large number of students who are educationally underprepared. The PI?s current expertise is in molecular biology research. Thus to successfully carry out this education research, the PI will pursue professional development to develop deep subject-matter knowledge in the field of biology education research, expertise in study design for education research, and expertise in statistical analysis of quantitative data. These goals will be achieved with the guidance of four expert mentors, and by taking summer classes in statistical analysis. This research project and the PI?s change in overall career trajectory will broaden participation in STEM careers by facilitating the transfer of successful pedagogies between different educational contexts. <br/><br/>The CURE that will be studied is a Tiny Earth lab that was implemented in Introductory Biology I at a regional comprehensive university with an extremely diverse student body in socio-economic background and student preparation. The project research goals are to determine whether the CURE lab (1) increases student self-efficacy, project ownership, and perceptions of biology; (2) affects content knowledge in the associated lecture class; and (3) has longitudinal effects on persistence. For each goal, the PI will also specifically address whether underprepared students are differentially affected by the CURE lab. The PI will use established instruments to survey students, will compare student exam scores in the associated lecture class, and will compare enrollment in an upper-level required course. For each analysis, the PI will use regression models to control for student preparation and other co-variates. This research will enhance our understanding of how the effects of pedagogy differ between contexts, especially in effects on underprepared students, and it will enhance our understanding of the positive benefits of CUREs.   <br/><br/>The project is supported through the EHR Core Research: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) competition that is designed to build individuals? capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, cyberbullying has been connected to negative mental health outcomes for adolescents. Addressing cyberbullying and cybersecurity issues in these spaces is therefore essential for healthy social development. While cyberbullying is of concern for all adolescents, adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are especially vulnerable and are at a higher risk of becoming victims of bullying and theft of personal data. This research addresses these issues by creating and employing personalized virtual companions, whose interactions with the adolescent are guided by artificial intelligence (AI). The personalized virtual companion will guide adolescents with ASD to improve their self-protection strategies and increase their cybertechnology knowledge. The goal of the project is to help prepare these individuals to become productive and satisfied members of a modern, inclusive, and technology-savvy workforce.<br/><br/>This project will address the problem of cyberbullying and cybersecurity for adolescents with ASD by developing tools based on deep learning algorithms that employ multimodal data, e.g., facial expression, body posture, breathing rate, skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, eye gaze, verbalization, and vocalization. Fusing data from these diverse sources is expected to enable creation of a virtual learning environment that is inhabited by autonomous agents, some of which have bullying or privacy-invading tendencies, and one of which is a personalized companion that seeks to help its human friend navigate the Internet. The AI companion must adapt its interactions based on understanding the external (verbal and nonverbal) behaviors and internal stress indicators (e.g., neurosensory) of its human counterpart. Development of an AI companion is especially challenging when working with members of a vulnerable population whose facial expressions and vocalizations do not always match those of neurotypical adolescents. A current issue with this type of research is that training datasets are populated by neurotypical subjects and thus are potentially not representative of the population this project is intended to serve, adolescents with ASD.  The desired outcomes from the project are novel deep learning algorithms to address the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art multimodal Facial Expression Recognition algorithms currently designed for neurotypical adolescents.  The project may also aid self-regulation of ASD adolescents when faced with cyberbullying and attempts to invade privacy as well as other social situations.  It should also lead to an understanding of how this AI intervention strengthens the individual?s knowledge of technology and their affinity for cybersecurity careers.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

WREAs include internships, co-ops, practicums, job shadowing, and other similar opportunities that enable students to apply knowledge in an authentic setting and that lead to successful and productive employment.  The research will fill a knowledge gap by empirically documenting the influence of locale on internships and similar professional development opportunities for students. The research is guided by proximity research, constructs implicit in critical human geography that can be examined through dimensions of socio-spatial relations, and the notion of opportunity structures, defined as the full range of opportunities available to students that organize their education and future trajectories. The study will offer thoughtful insight into the employability discourse and demonstrate the importance of the contextual nuance of geographic locale. The study is expected to produce information about the impact of geographic locale on professional development opportunities for students and help strengthen the STEM pipeline from education to the workforce, particularly for students who may be less connected to major workforce hubs.<br/><br/>Guided by proximity research, the researchers will employ a mixed methods design to  answer the following research questions: (1) How and to what extent does geographic locale affect STEM students? access to work-related experimental activities? (2) Do students, university career officials, and/or new employees perceive access to or benefit from WREAs differently based on their institution?s geographic locale? (3) Are there other facets of structural opportunities that intersect with locale that further affect students? access to or perceptions of WREAs? (4) Does WREA participation affect time to degree and/or time between degree completion and job offer? (5) For recent graduates, who have not secured employment, does their locale contribute to the reason for unemployment, and was their participation in WREAs different from that of peers who have acquired employment? And (6) Do employees who participate in WREAs receive higher salary offers than peers who do not participate in WREAs?  Survey data will be collected in multiple phases from enrolled students, employers, and recently hired alumni employees who recruit from five public universities in Georgia, and geospatial analyses will visually situate students in the study, institutions, and WREA locations. Geospatial analyses will consider factors such as physical and functional distances to workplaces and overall amenities. Analysis of qualitative data will provide nuanced information about specific WREA activities as perceived by employers and recently hired employees, while quantitative analysis will provide students? attitudes and behaviors that show connections between WREA activities and student success.

Internships, mandated by many STEM academic programs, are a form of work-based learning that can lead to academic and workforce success for undergraduate and graduate students. Traditional face-to-face internships also can enhance students? social networks and technical and transferrable  professional skills. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has made face-to-face internships untenable for many workplaces, with stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements, resulting in a large influx of college students to vendors such as Parker Dewey seeking these opportunities.  However, there is little research on the quality of online or micro-internships, and higher education professionals have little knowledge about their students? experiences with these new forms of work-based learning and their subsequent impact on students? career and academic development.

Not surprisingly, privacy-enhancing technologies and innovations are critical to mitigating the adverse effects of intentional exploitation and protecting AI systems. However, resources for AI-cybersecurity cross-training are limited, and even fewer programs integrate topics, techniques and research innovations pertaining to privacy in their basic curricula covering AI or cybersecurity.

During this time, STEM graduate education has continued to rely largely on traditional learning models. These learning models historically have not emphasized professional skills development and career exploration, now recognized as key to long-term career success in STEM fields. Many institutions encourage students to address career and professional development needs through optional extra-curricular opportunities. The sporadic nature of these opportunities makes it difficult for students and faculty to learn about programs and to use them for effective learning. Moreover, when professional development and career exploration are not intentionally built into the arc of graduate training and assessed for effectiveness, graduate programs risk poor use of resources and an inconsistent training experience. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Michigan will develop an adaptive professional training (APT) system that will gather opportunities across the institution from different levels (e.g. department, college, university, external) into a single system. The data and knowledge gained from the system will help to guide skill development for graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will test the idea that providing a structured learning framework for professional development guided by formative mentor feedback and artificial intelligence-directed recommendations will enable more effective professional skill-building and student career success.  The proposed platform, the Adaptive Professional Training (APT) learning management system (LMS) will integrate the following key innovations: (1) a user-friendly online hub of learning opportunity listings across the institution and beyond linked with defined by core professional skill competencies, (2) adaptive and iterative learning recommendations tailored to individual needs and interests based on both mentor and trainee input, (3) portfolio building, and (4) program assessment capabilities to enable evidence-based educational policy and resource optimization. This APT LMS represents a new flexible learning paradigm by which diverse professional training opportunities can be intentionally integrated into STEM graduate education. We will test whether use of the APT LMS by a test student cohort, compared to a control student cohort, will promote more intentional time investment in professional development and more uniform improvement in defined competencies, like science communication and increased awareness of learning resources. We predict that this innovative educational approach will integrate student and mentor input, enabling planning, documentation, and engagement in a systematic manner, leading to more effective acquisition of the professional skills associated with student career success. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will address two fundamental education research questions: How can project management skill training be integrated with thesis research in graduate education? What is the role (or value) of learning communities in enhancing the training and retention of professional skills and effectiveness of thesis research? Studies suggest that current graduate education focuses too narrowly on thesis research, and graduate students are not well prepared with skills for future work in industry or the academy. However, limited resources and lack of faculty support prevent students from committing to skill training. To address these challenges, this e program will develop innovative training approaches to help students learn and practice project management skills. <br/><br/>Utilizing the framework of communities of practice, the project will have two major innovations. The first is engaging students with self-directed, learning activities to produce and evaluate new course content as they learn from the curated online modules. The second is practicing the professional skills integrated with the thesis research. This new learning model has the potential to fundamentally change the culture of graduate education, efficiently utilize the current resources, and obtain faculty buy-in. Associated research design will explore factors that may lead to the success of a learning community, help reconceptualize current graduate education and encourage broader adoption of these new approaches within and beyond STEM fields. The evaluation approach is informed by the pragmatic evaluation paradigm, and a variety of data will be collected in the study including program participation data, document analysis, student surveys, and faculty and industry partner interviews. The program will rigorously test over multiple cohort iterations and with control groups the benefits of this approach, including the synergy created between thesis research and professional skill training through the GAPS program.

The underlying assumptions of the project are that URMs may experience greater economic hardship and erosion in motivation to complete a graduate degree  during crises. To address this problem, the Council of Graduate Schools will collaborate with the Council for Opportunity in Education and the Council of Historically Black Graduate Schools to collect and analyze data to document the critical decision points for URM students and establish baseline information about their graduate school aspirations and attitudes toward completion during the pandemic. The project will produce results that can inform graduate student advising and support structures to address the current challenges and guide interventions to broaden participation in STEM graduate education.<br/><br/>The investigators will investigate four research questions: (1) What are the obstacles to the matriculation of underrepresented graduate students in the Fall 2020? (2) What are the obstacles to the retention of underrepresented students currently enrolled  in STEM graduate programs? (3) What are the challenges for sustaining graduate school aspirations among URM rising college seniors following the COVID-19 pandemic? and (4) In an environment where experiential learning experiences have been disrupted by the pandemic, what strategies are being used to prepare URMs for graduate school success?  Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected from undergraduate pipeline program directors, graduate deans, and other key stakeholders through surveys and focus groups.  Data will be analyzed using both simple descriptive and multivariate regression techniques, and the results will be shared broadly with the graduate education community.  <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition of the EHR Core Research program.

There is currently a shortage of cybersecurity educators and academic jobs in cybersecurity vastly outnumber applicants. Only 20% of traditional cybersecurity PhD students are selecting academia, most going to the private sector, and so a different approach is necessary. This project is designed to remove some of the barriers for working cybersecurity professionals to enter academia. Evidence, particularly in the STEM field, indicates that stronger knowledge of education principles and practices, leads to better teaching. The result of this project should be additional and more diverse educators, including females, with extensive cybersecurity experience, who can offer better cybersecurity education to address the current shortage in the cybersecurity workforce. The curriculum and project assessment results will be widely disseminated for application at a variety of community colleges and 4-year institutions. <br/><br/>The project develops a credentialing program for high-level cybersecurity professionals, currently enrolled in a cybersecurity terminal-degree program, to expand their skills in areas such as innovative teaching strategies, engaging students in the classroom, assessing student learning through different strategies, incorporating student research into a course, and preparing for the workforce. Doctoral students learn how to teach from educational professionals based on the science behind the education field and apply their cybersecurity knowledge in a structured manner to a diverse set of students. The doctoral students practice what they learn in one or two mentored teaching semester-long assignments at a variety of institutions.  Education and cybersecurity faculty evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching throughout the designated courses and provide guidance from curriculum development to assessment. Results of these courses are evaluated against other courses taught by doctoral students who have not been through the credentialing program.

However, educational programs and resources have not kept up with digital forensics artifacts - which are the cornerstone of real-world investigations. Practitioners face the challenge of the diversity and volume of digital forensic artifacts they encounter. This makes the process of integrating artifacts into educational programs difficult. Little to no research has focused on creating scalable educational material that may be employed by instructors to teach the process of artifact curation and analysis. This is not only causing a learning gap in academic programs but is decreasing the possibility of students graduating with the necessary skills to conduct artifact analysis upon graduation.

The reasons likely range from mistakes in daily research practice to misconduct and fraud. Better ethics education is one mechanism that can lead to better conduct in science. Mandatory courses such as ?Responsible Conduct of Research? (RCR) serve to teach topics in the field of science ethics and integrity at most institutions. Much has been published on improving the pedagogy of research ethics education, however, many RCR courses still focus on describing flawless ethical practice on the one hand and denouncing cases of outright misconduct or fraud on the other. The large grey zone in between, the so-called questionable research practices (QRPs) are rarely taught in a formal manner.

The researchers will focus specifically on how student mobility influences and interacts with the following student outcomes - mathematics achievement, behavior, social-emotional learning and other forms of development, such as language acquisition and disability status ? for vulnerable populations in California. Student mobility is defined as students changing schools either midyear or from one year to the next (i.e., during the summer) in grades that do not correspond to the terminal grade of the school. Vulnerable populations are defined as economically disadvantaged students, English learners (ELs), students with disabilities (SWDs), homeless (HL), and foster youth (FY). Student mobility, unlike residential mobility, occurs in the public realm, so that its potentially negative effects are more malleable and amenable to policy solutions. Mobility is disproportionately high for poor and vulnerable students. Such students often face profound challenges associated with family instability, and schools often struggle to recognize and accommodate mobile students' social, developmental, and intellectual needs. Knowing how vulnerable students rebound after a move, how long it takes, and how responses to moves differ by the grade level in which moves occur is key to shaping supports for these students. Findings from this project have the potential to aid districts and schools in understanding and grappling with the incidence and consequences of non-promotional student mobility.<br/><br/>The study will focus on all K-12 students in six large California school districts that are part of the Project CORE initiative - a group of districts that collaborate on data collection and analysis for continuous improvement. These include Los Angeles, Oakland, Fresno, Long Beach, Garden Grove, and Santa Ana. These districts have embraced systematic measurement of social-emotional learning and school culture and climate for school accountability. These CORE districts serve more than 900,000 - the longitudinal sample includes several million student-level observations over the 2010/11-2016/17 period. Using a careful framework designed to account for the incidence and consequences of student mobility and using statistical regression techniques, the researchers will comprehensively assess (1) the incidence of mid-year and summer mobility among vulnerable students in California and (2) the impact of mobility on these students' mathematical, behavioral, and social-emotional outcomes, as well as how these outcomes interact with one another. The researchers will track student outcomes before and after moves, distinguishing among moves of different types - structural, non-structural, voluntary, involuntary - comparing school changers to stayers. Since mobility could have positive effects in some situations and negative effects in others, the research will account for the timing and reasons why students change schools and identify variation in the incidence and consequences of mobility across vulnerable and other demographic groups. Moreover, the study will use information on school characteristics, culture and climate that students leave and enter and the degree to which mobile students ""match"" or fit in with their environments to determine the effect of school features on the outcomes of vulnerable students who are mobile. Too often STEM outcomes are investigated in isolation - in this study, the focus is on understanding how mathematics achievement interacts with emotional development and behavior for vulnerable students grappling with the challenge of changing schools. The holistic approach taken in this study will ensure the intertwined academic and social-emotional responses of students to changing schools is fully investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite an interdisciplinary consensus that IDPs, when used properly, provide a framework for helping graduate students achieve their career goals, there is little alignment among STEM disciplines and institutions about the specific, measurable outcomes of IDP use. This knowledge gap inhibits the availability of reliable effective practices for IDP use and its wide adoption among educators. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the American Chemical Society will help define core goals for the IDP process used across STEM disciplines and help develop tools that measure the impact of IDPs on the professional development of graduate students in STEM. The project outcomes will catalyze the generation of evidence for effective use of IDPs - evidence that is needed to scale the use of the IDP process, support and inform additional investments in career planning and graduate education, and foster growth of the field of PhD career development. Ultimately, results from this project have the potential to improve educational outcomes in graduate education and to better prepare the U.S. workforce. <br/><br/>This project will work nationally across STEM disciplines to align activities associated with implementing and measuring the impact of the IDP process, fulfilling three project objectives: (1) define core goals and measurable outcomes for the IDP process; (2) develop and test a set of instruments for demonstrating changes in student actions and attitudes resulting from use of the IDP process; and (3) recommend strategies for building a base of evidence on how and why the IDP process works in various contexts. The innovation of this project will be a tool-kit - a collection of standard impact indicators, a set of validated instruments, and guidance on their use - to be used across the STEM graduate education community. Initial drafts of the instruments will be created based on prior research, interviews with a range of STEM stakeholders, and feedback from career planning professionals and assessment experts. The collection of psychometric surveys and other tools will be pre-tested using cognitive interviews, field-tested with students from various graduate programs and backgrounds, and pilot-tested at selected campuses with a statistically relevant number of graduate students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Stakeholder interviews, input from gatherings of subject matter experts, insights from and surveys of those attending discussions with and presentations to the STEM graduate education and career development communities, focus groups of graduate students, and results from use of the tool-kit will be among the methods used to test two project hypotheses: (1) a set of instruments can be developed to measure the impacts of the IDP process as it is used in different ways to guide students with different backgrounds, experiences, and career goals; and (2) engaging a range of stakeholders, nationally and at academic institutions, in developing and testing this set of instruments will form a cadre that is interested and invested in using the project findings, resources, and recommendations to build a broader and more robust research base on the effective use and impact of the IDP process on graduate students. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

It includes an education plan focused on transferring the research to improve education.  Because these context-rich, problem-solving experiences more closely mimic professional work, they offer important venues for STEM workforce development. However, these environments tend to be resource and time-intensive compared to lecture courses, so it is important to understand their unique benefits. The level of ""context"" refers to the complexity of the goals, tools, and applications for learning. While there is a substantial amount of education research related to lower-context learning, such as active learning in lecture courses emphasizing knowing, concepts, and the acquisition of knowledge, there has been less education research on high context (""context-rich"") environments. such as laboratories and actual research experiences that involve practice.  The project will support the improvement of context-rich experiences that develop the science and engineering workforce, support retention and diversity, create free and publicly available assessments for STEM faculty, and guide policies on expanding and improving access to research experiences and other context-rich environments.  The project addresses a national need for research that can inform the development, testing, validation, and dissemination of assessments of learning in context-rich environments and guide education policy.<br/><br/>This research will examine how context-rich experiences prepare students for STEM workforce careers.   The research plan involves describing the experience, observing evidence for learning, comparisons of activities, outcomes, and the development of new assessments.  The conceptual framework is based on applying Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) to learning in context-rich settings.  CHAT provides a perspective that situates cognition within an activity system that relates a subject, an objective, and a community as an activity system that accomplishes practical outcomes. Data collection and analysis will utilize Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), particularly to understand mechanisms and factors within context-rich problem-solving environments that support outcomes such as development of professional identity, self-efficacy, and persistence.  The education plan involves a project based first-year physics course, as well as the development of a set of validated tools that could be used for the assessment of learning in context-rich environments.  Thus, the education plan is integrated with the research activities and would provide both local (course-specific) and transferable (disseminated) outcomes.  <br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.  ECR supports fundamental research that advances knowledge on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These attacks?including phishing, data disclosure, denial of service, and ransomware attacks?threaten students? and schools? cyber safety and privacy by making their personal and educational information vulnerable. These increasing cybersecurity threats highlight a need for cybersecurity education targeted to school administrators and staff to ensure they are adequately prepared to decide which educational technologies to use and how to optimize their security configurations and features. This project will provide cybersecurity education directly to school administrators, technology support staff, and teachers across North Carolina through the novel Cybersecurity Awareness-Ask-Action (AAA) program. This professional development program will equip school educators with a deeper awareness of how to secure their educational technologies, the communication skills to enable them to ask security- and privacy-related questions of software providers, and critical information on how to act when they recognize a threat to the digital privacy and security of their schools.<br/><br/>The project has three goals. First, K-12 school personnel will identify and analyze educational technology applications for collection, storage, and access to different student and school data types.  Second, the project team will design and develop workshop modules for school administrators, technology support staff, and teachers. Last, the team will facilitate a summer Cybersecurity AAA program to implement the modules with school administrators, technology support staff, and teachers. Outcomes are expected to improve the cybersecurity protection of K-12 school systems and further secure their student data. Evaluation results will be used to improve training modules. Materials will be made freely available for use by other school systems across the country.   <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

As a result, understanding these concepts and their relationship with cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important both for all students and the nation?s workforce. Providing engaging learning experiences for K-12 learners around cybersecurity and AI education is critical, especially during the early teen years when individuals are developing career aspirations and interests.  This is beneficial at the level of both individuals and the nation, as it contributes to the development of the nation?s future STEM workforce and citizenry. Current K-12 cybersecurity education is largely accomplished through ?digital literacy? activities in classrooms or out-of-school initiatives with few authentic programming    elements for younger learners. Moreover, AI/ML do not feature in these curricula even though AI efforts in K-12 schools are separately garnering attention. This case- and play-based learning (CAPABLE) module for cybersecurity and AI education project will address this gap in cybersecurity and AI/ML education for K-12 learners. The project will develop an authentic, engaging learning experience that will introduce students in grades 8-10 to the fundamentals of cybersecurity and its interplay with AI.<br/> <br/>The proposed effort will innovate in the areas of curriculum and pedagogy to systematically integrate ideas from cybersecurity, AI, and ML. These topics are typically taught separately, if at all, and providing integrated learning experiences in these critical computer science (CS) topics will empower learners in their early teen years. The project will involve development and empirical investigation of a 40-hour learning module?AI & Cybersecurity for Teens (ACT)?to motivate and engage students aged 13-15. The ACT module will be made available for use in cybersecurity camps and/or as an extension to CS and/or AI curricula in school classrooms. The curriculum and pedagogy will utilize collaborative board or card games to orient students to cybersecurity concepts. It will also include an innovative collection of authentic, real-world ?cases? related to cybersecurity issues (such as cyberfraud, cyberbullying, hacking, phishing) with which young teens can identify. These will be paired with related, transformative programming exercises in the NetsBlox programming environment and involving AI/ML, which will help build student understanding of ML models and AI/ML techniques including text classification, neural networks and generative adversarial networks. The project team will also design a Cybersecurity Scenario-Based Assessment to assess understanding of cybersecurity and AI/ML concepts.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

Training students to work with multiple stakeholders, such as non-profit organizations and local populations could better prepare them to address problems that involve multiple disciplines or perspectives.  For example, humanitarian organizations are engaging both STEM professionals and members of affected populations to design innovative interventions for refugee relief and response. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will train STEM graduate students to adopt more collaborative and inclusive approaches to problem-solving within the humanitarian response context. MIT D-Lab, which focuses on Development through Discovery, Design and Dissemination, will expand its contributions to the humanitarian relief sector through a novel approach to teaching graduate-level design and systems thinking courses.  The goal is to train future STEM leaders to incorporate a more inclusive and participatory approach to problem solving. MIT D-Lab will develop, pilot, and evaluate a multi-week module on how to effectively facilitate co-creative design sessions that include both humanitarian organizations and affected populations on the design team throughout the entire process. While the module is being developed and tested within the context of D-Lab?s humanitarian efforts, it has applications in many other settings, both in academia and in the field.<br/><br/>Researchers will develop and pilot elements of the design and systems thinking module in D-Lab, the Systems Design and Management program and the Urban Risk Lab at MIT; in the Humanitarian Engineering program at Oregon State University; in the Program on Forced Migration and Health at Columbia University; and in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. In parallel, students will work on a semester-long project with a partner organization (such as Oxfam, UNICEF or the Red Cross) to develop a co-creative activity between the organization and an affected population. After the class, students will have the opportunity to work with D-Lab staff and partners in the field to deliver the co-creative activity. The researchers will measure learning outcomes for the curriculum and identify changes in the students? skills, knowledge, and attitudes. In addition, researchers will determine the effectiveness of co-creation processes and will compare the activities developed as part of this project to the current process for identifying solutions and engaging users in the humanitarian sector.

This project aims to serve the national interest by addressing the inequitable representation of graduate Women of Color (WoC) (i.e., Black/African American, Latina, Indigenous, and Asian American women) in STEM. This continued underrepresentation of WoC has been attributed, in part, to negative encounters in STEM characterized by alienating and marginalizing program environments. Yet, existing efforts designed to broaden participation in STEM have largely focused on academic and professional challenges that influence STEM persistence, with little attention to the psychological toll of persisting in STEM environments rife with systemic oppression (e.g., gendered racism). Research has linked racism-related stress, perceived discrimination, microaggressions, minority status stress, and isolation to many negative psychological outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, increased psychological distress has been shown to negatively influence academic and research productivity. Evidently, mental health and distress are crucial, yet unexamined, factors that can influence STEM persistence. To address this knowledge gap and improve the representation of graduate WoC in STEM, this project seeks to understand the psychological toll that results from navigating negative STEM environments. It will also identify specific institutional factors that either mitigate or perpetuate the marginalizing encounters that affect graduate WoC?s mental health.<br/><br/>The project employs a two-phase, multi-methodological, longitudinal, and experimental approach grounded in well-established theories from social and counseling psychology. Phase I will obtain rich insights about the contributors and deterrents to STEM graduate WoC?s mental health using three complementary studies: a sequential mixed-methodological nationwide examination of the state of mental health among graduate WoC in STEM (Study 1); and a series of semi-structured critical incident interviews with both current graduate WoC in STEM as well as those who have prematurely discontinued their STEM doctoral pursuits to understand supportive (Study 2) and unsupportive (Study 3) faculty behaviors that affect the respondents? mental health. Phase II will build on the insights gained in Phase I to design and evaluate an innovative and transformative culturally responsive wellness intervention for graduate WoC (Study 4). The output of this research will serve the following educational goals: (1) cultivate awareness and change among STEM faculty to combat racist and marginalizing encounters; (2) establish a scalable and sustainable restorative wellness program designed to promote graduate WoC?s STEM persistence in a manner that is wholesome, enriching, and centered on thriving; and (3) leverage cross-disciplinary partnerships with counseling professionals to design an innovative and culturally responsive graduate curriculum.

The investigator will use an evaluation design  and persistence framework to (a) examine the impact of DT training on undergraduate student persistence and retention in STEM and (b) examine the impact of combining DT training with course-based undergraduate research experiences on undergraduate student persistence and retention in STEM.  The testbed for the bulk of the research will be the first-year seminar program where entering freshmen are required to take a university general education seminar course. Classes are comprised of STEM and non-STEM majors, allowing the investigator to test the potential for STEM recruitment. The course curriculum will merge instructions in foundations of neuroscience with demonstrations and activities that train students to use a variety of tools to measure electrical activity from the nervous system.  Students will them work in groups on pre-defined projects to study novel aspects of neuroscience. Pre- and post-surveys will be conducted to collect data that will compare outcomes that are theoretically correlated with long-term success.  The project will produce evidence of effective educational practices that promote student success in STEM and contribute to greater diversity in STEM education and the workforce. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the ECR Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition of the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

Lately, AI has been shown to be able to create machine cognition comparable to or even better than human cognition for some applications. AI is also regarded to achieve cybersecurity (i.e., AI for cybersecurity) such as by detecting anomalies, adapting security parameters based on ongoing cyber-attacks, and reacting in real-time to combat cyber-adversaries. However, ML algorithms and AI systems can be controlled, dodged, biased, and misled through flawed learning models and input data. Therefore, ML and AI need robust security and correctness (i.e., cybersecurity for AI) to permit fair and trustworthy AI. Unfortunately, AI and cybersecurity have been treated as two different domains and are not taught as cross-cutting technologies. The primary goal of this project is to explore, develop and integrate a scalable instructional approach for AI-driven cybersecurity and cybersecurity for AI in undergraduate and graduate curricula.  This will be accomplished by creating a ""learning by doing"" environment to address emerging AI and cybersecurity issues that are not covered in an integrated way, if at all, in traditional curricula. This project will help to train the next-generation STEM workforce with knowledge of integrated cybersecurity and AI that will help not only to meet evolving demands of the US government and industries but also to improve the nation?s economic security and preparedness. <br/><br/>The core scientific contributions of the proposed research effort will be the development and enhancement of integrated AI and cybersecurity education and research programs at Howard University by leveraging the proposed Discovery, Analysis, Research and Exploration (DARE-AI) -based experiential learning platform to address emerging issues and challenges. The project team proposes to design, develop, use, and refine reproducible hands-on activities by integrating cybersecurity and AI education and research with open-ended problem-solving activities. The effectiveness of coupling of AI for cybersecurity and cybersecurity for AI in DARE-AI modules will be evaluated.  The project team will also design, develop, use, and refine the machine learning model with privacy, security, and distributed learning.  Machine learning algorithms and AI systems will be designed, developed, and analyzed for robustness, fairness and the extent to which they make AI systems explainable and accountable. The research results from this project will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations. The DARE-AI modules will also be published on the project?s dedicated website to make them available to the public.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

Fostering and facilitating the dynamics of healthy online behaviors, conflict and identity is relevant to producing responsible 21st-century learners in our schools and communities. There is a critical need to develop educational materials and research around experiences emphasizing digital safety for elementary school students. The outcome of this project has the potential to greatly improve digital safety for children without restricting their learning opportunities. This project will also provide undergraduate and graduate students in computing and education majors with the opportunity to gain experience by involving them in the design of the educational materials as well as the evaluation and research activities. The implementation of security education for elementary school grades will promote modernization of digital safety educational materials and help elementary schools adapt to technology development and prepare responsible 21st century learners.<br/><br/>This project addresses the need for digital safety and privacy education at the elementary school level. To accomplish this goal the project will design a comprehensive suite of digital safety educational materials for elementary school students in Grades 3-5. Topics will include cyberbullying,  digital security and privacy, footprint, and the correct way of communicating on the Internet. The materials will be disseminated to students by training 40 elementary school in-service and pre-service teachers through workshops in the greater Charlotte, North Carolina area. Week-long digital safety summer camps will reach 400 elementary school students  and will be used to conduct thorough evaluation and improvement of the educational materials. The project will also engage parents through a Parent workshop and will explore the formation of a Student-Parent-Teacher-Researcher coalition for future digital safety education.  In addition, the project proposes to apply a train-the-trainer model to ensure the materials reach a wide range of end users.

Unfortunately, there are numerous obstacles in contemporary scientific research that preclude universal reproducibility. These range from key omissions or vague instructions in the experimental description to journals that require subscriptions and thus restrict access to the entire scientific product.  Open Science is an approach to conducting reproducible research, but its practices are difficult and time-consuming to adopt. The National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to University of Georgia will pilot an educational program that teams up students and faculty conducting research, with the ultimate goal of lowering barriers to conducting Open Science and catalyzing an institutional shift toward an open and transparent approach to science. The project will incentivize Open Science practices in research and education and will provide additional training opportunities to students and faculty alike to obtain skills in Open Science that are otherwise not offered in a contemporary research setting. This project will establish new curricula, creating new opportunities for future students and faculty as well as endowing them with skills that are highly sought in a variety of fields. <br/><br/>Recent surveys reveal a pervasive belief that there is a broad reproducibility crisis in science. Examples abound across disciplines: seminal studies have been, upon later scrutiny and attempts to replicate, revealed as irreproducible. Open Science offers a principled, albeit abstract, approach to scientific research that emphasizes openness and reproducibility. Most scientists agree reproducibility must be addressed. Yet, the adoption of open practices has remained anemic, as the culture surrounding research has not been sufficiently incentivized to change, nor has the practice of Open Science been defined as a concrete process. This 3-year project aims to study how to catalyze a cultural shift in the research and educational practices at the University of Georgia. Critically, the approach is process-oriented and bidirectional: students will be recruited at varying stages of their graduate careers as the experimental cohort, and a peer support structure will be established among them. Faculty will also be recruited: supervisors of participating graduate students and experts in Open Science and institutional change. These students and faculty, representing a variety of STEM disciplines, will participate in a series of workshops to obtain a formal understanding of Open Science. Participating faculty will sustain this curriculum through their own Open Science training with external experts, course modifications, and an interdisciplinary graduate certificate program formalizing the coursework and standards for training in Open Science principles and practices. This will establish a network of influencers to effect broad institutional change, further facilitating a cultural shift toward adoption of Open Science. <br/><br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

URM students enroll in and complete PhD degrees in STEM at a much lower rate than majority groups; they also often face what educational researchers refer to as ?climates of intimidation? within higher education and STEM. This project?s goals are to support students? empowerment, agency and authenticity for academic success and social integration into STEM.  This will be accomplished with a training program that translates the evidence-based findings of the learning disabilities communities to promote self-advocacy and positively impact the retention and academic success of URM PhD students. This IGE will address whether teaching self-advocacy increases the academic success, social integration and general well-being of URM PhD STEM students, and thereby lead to improvements in doctoral degree attainment.<br/> <br/>A comprehensive review of evidence-based practices for teaching self-advocacy within the learning disability communities found that there are three critical factors that, when combined, result in increased academic success: empowerment, self-awareness, and social justice. Self-advocacy has been shown to increase students? retention during critical transitions to post-secondary education or increase participation in learning STEM disciplines, while also increasing academic success. Thus, the research hypothesis is that teaching self-advocacy will result in improved academic success, improved social integration, and improved health and well-being for URM STEM graduate students at UIC, many of whom are first generation or low-income. The societal impact of this grant will be a successful graduate education program that is inclusive of URM students and that will inform on a broader scale how to increase participation of URM graduate students in STEM disciplines. It is anticipated that the translation of evidence-based educational practices from the learning disabilities communities will serve as a foundation for teaching self-advocacy to URM STEM graduate students, and further the translation of these practices to other student populations and fields at UIC and other institutions of higher learning that want to increase the academic success of their URM graduate students.

Scientists and engineers are generally not taught how to engage with the community as part of their research. teaching, or other long-term career goals. Graduate students often do not know how to access training in community engagement, are unaware of its importance, and/or lack the confidence or experience to take part. This project, the Public Service Fellows Program, will test a year-long professional development program as a means to prepare graduate students to view public service as a responsibility that comes with their scientific training. It will provide practical experience working with community partners on science-focused issues and projects. Integrating public service into STEM graduate student training will improve the practice of future generations of scientists by teaching the specific skills and mindsets needed for community engagement.

Fellows will be able to design their experience around one of four tracks: community-engaged teaching, direct service, policy, and social enterprise. Assessment will focus on two primary research questions: (1) What are graduate students' motivations to participate in the Public Service Fellows Program? and (2) How do students' professional identities change as a result of participation in the Public Service Fellows Program, and what component(s) of the program are primary contributors to these changes? The hypotheses are that community engagement will become a more integrated part of the fellows' professional identities, that graduate students who participate in the program will have an increased commitment to a community-engagement, regardless of career path, and that the biggest impact will be due to the in-depth practicum portion of the Public Service Fellows Program. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

Studies of interdisciplinary research teams indicate that team members struggle to achieve knowledge synthesis across disciplines. Issues arise due to the inability of team members to develop deep knowledge at the frontier of other disciplines and to connect that knowledge with their own expertise to provide a collaborative path forward. The ability to work collaboratively in a research team with others who may hold very different perspectives is a critical aspect of preparing today's students to meet future workforce demands. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track is a collaborative project led by the University of Texas at El Paso involving graduate students and faculty from multiple institutions.  The project will test a new model for training graduate student teams in environmental sciences to overcome knowledge integration and synthesis challenges.<br/><br/>This model will draw on findings from cognitive, learning, and social sciences to develop and test training for graduate students and faculty in model-based reasoning approaches. Model-based reasoning theory posits that humans reason by constructing an internal mental model of the situations, events, and processes that they encounter, and that external representations can be used to facilitate construction of these mental models. External representations include the use of analogies, metaphor, visual models, diagrams and/or other representations for abstraction and communication of complex concepts. In a team setting, these external representations are called boundary negotiating objects.  This project will place doctoral students in multidisciplinary teams and facilitate a structured, participatory process that includes a progression of standard, individual and group model-based reasoning activities as well as instruction on the purposeful co-creation of boundary negotiating objects.  Students from multiple institutions will learn together through two-week summer experiences; students who are conducting research in conjunction with larger interdisciplinary teams will be targeted.  In addition, the project will train faculty from multiple institution in the model.  The project will examine the implementation of ten faculty members.  Survey, interview, and digital data will be collected to examine how graduate students respond to being directly exposed to theories behind the approach as well as the efficacy of the approach as faculty employ it in their graduate classes.

This need also opens opportunities for women and students of color, traditionally underrepresented in engineering, to explore a broader range of research and career pathways that better identify with their interests and values. To support students in acquiring these skills, graduate curricula can benefit from a framework and process for designing educational modules that are accessible to students in different disciplines, that identifies how they contribute to their field, and integrates emerging business needs. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) and the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMD) will pilot a model for co-creation of cross-disciplinary educational content by teams of graduate students, research advisors, instructors, and practitioners from industry. The educational model is prototyped using a case study of cyber-physical systems applicable across a wide range of industries spanning the service, manufacturing, health-care, transportation, automation, and smart-system based environmental monitoring sectors. The project is innovative in its application of evidence-based practices from education research on how the curriculum can be inclusive in engaging and educating a diverse student body by involving graduate students in co-creating technical content.  <br/><br/>The project involves two phases. The first phase addresses how graduate students learn by co-creating educational material with faculty and experts from industry. The second phase integrates the modules developed in phase one into courses offered at four different institutions (UML, UMD, University of the District of Columbia, and North Carolina A&T State University) and assesses how students learn and acquire transferable skills from co-created material. Both phases prioritize students? voices in an iterative design and evaluation process through focus groups conducted in the framework of participatory action research. Through the co-creation in phase one, graduate students learn about: (a) Models and methods for integrating disciplinary approaches and avoiding common pitfalls; (b) Social science concepts (viz. intersectionality, microaggressions, and institutionalized racism) connected with underrepresentation of females and minorities in STEM fields, and (c) ways to address these issues through effective communication and practice. The educational modules support experiential learning on a testbed that emulates the stages of product life-cycle management (PLM) undertaken in industry and support the development of skills for transferring of discipline-specific information to stakeholders across the PLM stages ranging from ideation to product verification, validation, and usage. A tool kit will provide the templates and rubrics for participatory educational design and collection of common datasets to assess the projected learning outcomes from implementations by a broader graduate education community. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

The explosion of the illicit economy can be traced to the growth in online commerce and an ""abuse ecosystem"" of rogue internet actors, direct-to-consumer courier delivery services, and the lack of product protective measures to counteract counterfeiting. This increase is further fueled by new digital tools available to counterfeiters, such as higher resolution digital printers.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) collaborative award to four South Dakota universities (South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, University of South Dakota, South Dakota State University and Dakota State University) will provide graduate students with the scientific knowledge and professional skills and training needed to become next-generation leaders in the fight against counterfeiting.  Participants will receive professional and leadership training within the framework of a unique cyber-physical-social model.  This model takes a comprehensive approach that factors in not only the technical aspects of the cyber strategies and physical methods used to combat counterfeiting, but also whether these strategies and methods are compatible with human behavior. This model will allow trainees to solve complex problems, where the solutions must tightly integrate cyber, physical, and social interactions in real-time.

These modules can then be used in standard computing curricula to create a cybersecurity proficient software workforce that can significantly enhance cybersecurity in the workplace.<br/><br/>The modules will be used in capstone courses at Informatics at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and Indiana University (IU).  The researchers will utilize the modules to create an assessment for the most critical and essential cybersecurity knowledge and skills. The outcomes of the research will advance the understanding of how students could develop sociotechnical cybersecurity proficiency as a part of their capstone experience.  Since capstones are typically a graduation requirement, integrating cybersecurity learning within these courses will have the transformative effect of all students in the computing disciplines graduating with core cybersecurity knowledge.  As a part of the research activities, several cohorts of undergraduates will receive cybersecurity training useful for their professional careers.  The learning modules and assessments will be openly available to other educators and institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today?s computer networks have grown both in complexity and in scale, in part as a response to diverse connectivity requirements in the era of the Internet of Things, Cloud 3.0, and Big Data. Existing network management solutions cannot keep up with the demand for solutions to real-time network management problems resulting from these increasingly complex networks. Network management requires a fundamentally new approach in which networks can autonomously control, configure, and manage themselves. While these ?self-driving networks? offer numerous opportunities for efficient network management, they introduce new threats and attack vectors that must be addressed to secure them. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortfall of professionals trained in autonomous and intelligent network security and a shortfall of content with which to train these professionals. This project will address these shortfalls by developing lab-intensive modules that enable undergraduate students to gain fundamental and advanced knowledge in securing next-generation self-driving networks. <br/><br/>The project team will develop six self-contained modules with comprehensive coverage of the techniques, tools, and methods required to secure self-driving networks. The modules will cover (1) attack investigation and analysis of legacy, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and adversarial attacks; (2) hunting for vulnerabilities using static analysis, software component analysis, automated known attack patterns, and behavioral analysis; (3) network-wide data collection using classic and OpenFlow based approaches; (4) protection using runtime application self-protection, automated patching, and security information and event management; (5) evaluation using continuous adaptive risk and thrust assessment; and (6) action using security orchestration, automation and response. In addition, this project aims to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM by organizing workshops and participating in professional conferences. The project team will also organize a workshop to disseminate the modules to interested faculty members from other organizations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

Yet, AI components are also vulnerable to attacks, and require development of techniques to make them more robust. This collaborative project between the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) and the University of Illinois addresses the research and educational aspects of combining AI and cybersecurity. Educational and training materials will be developed for use by college and university instructors and students and by cybersecurity and AI professionals. These materials will address how AI can improve security systems and how cybersecurity analytics can protect AI systems. In addition, the project will recruit students from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in computing. <br/><br/>This project has three interrelated topics. The first focuses on education and extends the project team?s existing cybersecurity concept inventory to include relevant AI-related concepts. Student knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity and AI relatedness will be assessed before and after taking AI or cybersecurity courses.  Educational materials and projects  will also be created to demonstrate  how AI can be applied to cybersecurity problems and how cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from attack. The second topic explores how the latest AI tools can support cybersecurity tasks. The creation and maintenance of semantic knowledge graphs of cyberthreat information will be studied and used to support reinforcement learning systems that are better at detecting the presence of malware in a host. The third topic focuses on finding new ways that cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from becoming compromised by attacks such as data poisoning. Cyberthreat knowledge graphs and neural networks will be used to detect and eliminate likely disinformation from data used to train AI-based cybersecurity systems.

However, there are major barriers to instilling the core knowledge of CFDE and practice of cyber investigation techniques in a diverse body of interested students. For example, a systematic approach for collecting, organizing, and analyzing digital forensic evidence is lacking. This project will engage novel interdisciplinary perspectives, including artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, criminal justice, and computer science to re-examine the emerging CFDE field with a formal approach.  This project will then explore visualized and explainable AI to improve students? learning experience in digital forensics education at Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).<br/><br/>The project brings together faculty from the University of Baltimore, an MSI, Bowie State University, one of the oldest HBCUs in Maryland, and the University of Missouri Kansas City, who have synergistic expertise in digital forensics, cybersecurity, AI, law, and computer science. The project will leverage graph-based AI models to provide students with visualized depictions of forensic evidence, the patterns of evidence, and the connections among the evidence. It will also explore explainable AI to support the development of forensic evidence that is accountable and presentable to courts, and develop AI-aided CFDE instructional materials. The project will address research questions at the intersection of AI, CFDE, and education including the following: (a) How do graph-based models store, retrieve, and present digital forensic evidence? (b) How do graph-based AI models discover new evidence and to what extent should we trust AI-discovered evidence/patterns?

Briefly stated, research identity refers to the ways in which graduate students define themselves as researchers and is an important factor in student success. Specifically, this project will implement and test approaches to foster research identity development for graduate students in non-research-intensive institutions. It should be noted that smaller institutions/programs often face deficiencies that can impact the ability of faculty mentors to foster student research identities both individually and as part of a larger group. In engineering, a faculty advisor generally guides the graduate research experience and the advisor is the primary resource to help graduate students develop their identities as engineering researchers.  Given this apprenticeship model, the mentoring and guidance that a student receives in developing a professional identity is largely dependent on the style, resources, and graduate student group size of the faculty mentor.  This project is testing interventions that could potentially overcome these limitations, particularly for students in smaller graduate programs.<br/><br/>This study on engineering research identity will be conducted at a Carnegie R2 institution (NCAT), a leading producer of African-American engineers, and it will implement a three-pronged approach that is grounded in sociological and psychological theories of identity.   The project entails (1) establishing a Research Engineer Network that will help graduate students develop a research engineer identity; (2) forming Small Research Groups of faculty members with common interests who will foster students' research skills; and (3) designing and administering a survey-based Research Engineer Identity scale and assessment using a mixed-methods research design that includes focus groups, structured interviews, and web-based surveys. The design will culminate with a quasi-experimental test comparing the development of research identify among students participating in the study and a control group of matched students. The three coordinated innovations in this project will collectively build and assess an innovative infrastructure for developing research identify in graduate engineering students. It is anticipated that the project results will be applicable to universities broadly, while particularly informing practice in smaller graduate programs.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

The project will lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness between STEM education materials and cybersecurity networks, and the commonalities that they face when challenged with the presence of hyper-realistic AI-generated data.   <br/><br/>This NSF EAGER project brings together researchers from K-12 (Challenger Center), higher education (Carnegie Mellon University), and the workforce (RAND Corporation) to investigate risks posed to the free flow of STEM education materials and computer network traffic data in the age of hyper-realistic AI-generated data. Participants engaged in the study will be randomly shown fake STEM content (i.e., STEM content that is generated by Generative Neural Networks and has been modified to include misinformation) vs. STEM content that is authentic in its communication of STEM information . Each participant will be asked to classify whether the STEM content being displayed is fake or authentic. Additional questions will probe how specific characteristics of the STEM content displayed to participants serve as indicators of authenticity by randomly assigning participants versions of the STEM content that contain or omit those characteristics. The study of different learner populations (K-12, higher education, and the adult workforce) will elucidate the variability that exists amongst learners? ability to decipher factual education material from AI-altered STEM education material, given the age and experience level of different learner populations. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

However, emerging hardware attack methods have originated from untrustworthy global supply chain sources and vulnerabilities inherent to the hardware. To address these challenges, the government and industry are in urgent need of cybersecurity professionals trained to counter hardware-oriented attacks. However, most students are insufficiently prepared because existing undergraduate curricula for electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and related programs focus primarily on the software and network aspects of cybersecurity. Few institutions have introduced dedicated hardware security courses and even when these courses exist, they are typically electives. This project aims to facilitate hardware security education for engineering undergraduate students by incorporating the relevant concepts into existing core courses. The project will broaden undergraduate students? participation; advance their knowledge; and create a well-trained and diversified cybersecurity workforce with essential knowledge of hardware security. The security-integrated contents of various core courses will be made available online for all universities and community colleges nationwide.  The participation of students who are members of underrepresented groups in cybersecurity education and research should also be catalyzed by this effort. <br/><br/>This project aims to integrate theoretical and practical training on six foundational hardware security concepts in core courses related to digital design and embedded systems.  Course modules will be distributed to the broader community after evaluation by industry and academic experts. Existing theory and lab modules within the target core courses will be augmented with security-oriented concepts through a ?contextual learning? process, so that they will strengthen the materials of the core course while educating on security.

This requires developers to gain a deep understanding of foundational concepts in secure programming, and continuously learn and practice defensive, secure, and robust coding. Given the current lack of consistent and comprehensive secure programming training in most computing programs, and the need for any training to evolve to meet new requirements, it is essential to have mechanisms that make secure programming training adaptive and intelligent. The goal for this project is to develop one such mechanism, named SecTutor, which is a dual-purpose adaptive testing and intelligent tutoring system. Using SecTutor, learners will be able to identify their current missing knowledge and areas of misunderstanding in secure programming, and access content to improve learning at their own pace. SecTutor will provide immediate feedback and learning analytics to motivate and guide learners.<br/><br/>The project will take an assessment-driven approach for personalized, self-directed learning: a rigorous assessment tests the learner's level of knowledge and skill so that the intelligent tutoring system can calibrate the instruction directly to the learner. Specifically, the first step of the project will be to construct an adaptive test to diagnose learners' current level of foundational understanding in secure programming. This adaptive test will be based on a rigorously constructed secure programming concept inventory. This test will also diagnose what topics the learner is finding difficult or is fundamentally not understanding. The next step of the project will be to build an intelligent tutorial system that will provide both content and guidance for the learner to master secure programming concepts and skills. The third step will be to incorporate learning analytics into the system that will not only provide feedback to individual learners, but also provide mechanisms for instructors to gather information about their learners, compare them to other demographics, analyze secure programming questions, and adapt their curriculum to address specific challenges or customized requirements. SecTutor will eventually be integrated into other existing secure programming resources and will be adopted broadly for secure programming training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The logs of student responses can capture answers, but they fail to capture critical information about what is happening during pauses between student interactions with the software. This project, led by a team of researchers at Arizona State University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, will explore the use of measurements of brain activity from lightweight brain sensors alongside student log data to understand important mental activities during learning. The study will examine developmental math learning in college and community college students using the ASSISTments intelligent tutoring system. Using brain imaging, the project team will examine whether students are thinking deeply about the problem or mind-wandering during pauses in the learning tasks and use the combined log and brain data to make predictions about learning outcomes.

This project addresses the gap in our understanding of how to prepare the workforce to apply AI to problems in cybersecurity by identifying workforce needs and developing solutions to learning barriers that could prevent broad participation in AI-enhanced cybersecurity. The project will create and disseminate an AI-enhanced cybersecurity course for advanced undergraduate and master's students and contribute new knowledge at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and education.<br/><br/>This project will identify workforce training needs for AI-enhanced cybersecurity through interviews with industry experts. This will inform the development of a course for master's and advanced undergraduate students that addresses gaps in existing cybersecurity curricular frameworks. The hands-on course will serve as a testbed to identify key conceptual challenges, prerequisites, and compelling examples of AI-enhanced cybersecurity. The course will train students at the University of Washington Bothell in crucial AI-enhanced cybersecurity skills. Additionally, the project seeks to identify opportunities to broaden participation at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. A better understanding of how computing majors perceive courses and careers in AI, cybersecurity, and the intersection of the two can inform efforts to broaden participation in AI-enhanced cybersecurity. This interdisciplinary collaboration will also prepare the project team to engage in education research at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

Previous work has shown that only a fraction of cyber abuse victims adopt self-protective behaviors. This may occur because some victims lack the background knowledge required to identify cyber abuse and to assert appropriate protective behaviors. While education can be effective in this regard, classroom delivery may fail to reproduce the diverse and dynamic context of cyber abuse, making it difficult for students to effectively translate knowledge into practice. This project seeks to increase the adoption of self-protective behaviors by integrating educational content into social networking interactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be used to optimize the placement and timing of educational content. The project has the potential to improve the security and privacy of vulnerable social network users.<br/><br/>The project team will leverage their expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and education to investigate, develop and evaluate a new educational framework that provides just-in-time awareness training to identify and respond appropriately to cyber abuse when using social networks. First, the team will develop AI-based solutions to detect and classify cyber abuse based on abuse traces in the accounts of the users involved. The team will also leverage data and feedback collected from study participants to build a ground-truth dataset of instances and timelines of cyber abuse. Second, the team will design and implement targeted learning content and user interface nudges to deliver the knowledge required to make safer decisions in social network interactions. Third, the team will develop AI-based techniques to determine the ideal placement of learning content that improves user adoption of self-protective behaviors. Finally, the unique features of Facebook will be exploited to design evaluation experiments and educational outcomes-based techniques that capture user behaviors in the context of their regular Facebook interactions.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

The goal is to use social network analysis with qualitative methods to characterize the professional support networks of women and GSM physicists to test the central hypothesis: professional support networks of these physicists will include substantial out-of-field or out-of-hierarchy elements and that significant differences may appear by employment sector.  The specific aims are to (1) identify the types of professional support networks experienced by GSM physicists, (2) compare professional support networks and career trajectories between different GSM identities, (3) compare professional support network characteristics among physics employment sectors, and (4) synthesize results into a professional support network survey that can be distributed to a wider scientist audience.  The project will provide a nuanced understanding of these changing roles and structures with the goal of broadening participation in physics for underrepresented or marginalized groups.  <br/><br/>The project will employ standpoint theory to investigate research questions that are aligned with the project aims. The framework motivates the importance of in-depth data collection that centers an individual with their multitude of experiences. It also suggests that individuals from underserved groups should not be compared to those from majority groups, but investigators should focus knowledge production from their voices and lives. Investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews to address three research questions: (1) How are the professional support networks of women and GSM in physics characterized? (2) How satisfied are women and GSM in physics with their career trajectories and current jobs? What network patterns are associated with higher satisfaction and sense of professional identity? (3) What similarities and differences exist among employment sectors?  Investigators will use qualitative methods to analyze and code participant surveys and ego network analysis to focus the exploration of the professional networks of women and GSM physicists. The project contributes guidance for universities, professional societies, and mentors to better understand the professional network needs of women and GSM scientists.  <br/><br/>The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program that supports fundamental research focused on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM professional workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current project leverages the research infrastructure that was supported by prior awards to examine how peer effects, network connections, and employer demand shape career outcomes for doctoral students. It integrates comprehensive administrative data for 113,000 doctoral students, UMETRICS research data, Proquest data on dissertations with information on fields of study and research, and restricted Census Bureau data on earnings and employment outcomes. Dara integration will occur under the umbrella of the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS). The project will contribute new knowledge by articulating and testing key aspects of a novel conceptual model of STEM career choices. This theoretical and empirical work will establish basic facts about how demand and training conditions shape early STEM career choices that can be determine only through the integration of separate datasets. The project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The research design integrates three approaches - peer-based, network-based, and demand. In their peer-based approach, the researchers propose to take the composition of peers in entering graduate cohorts to be quasi-random and estimate how the composition of peers interacts with their own characteristics. A second set of analyses involves identifying labs from the data and estimating how the composition of the persons in a lab relate to outcomes. The network-based approach will be used to examine how individual differences in social capital shape doctoral student outcomes. The demand will answer the analytical question of the effect of actual and perceived labor market demand on the choice of careers. The analysis will begin with a description of the early career outcomes of students from undergraduate dropouts to college graduates, from master's students to Ph.D. dropouts to doctoral recipients.  In addition to enhancing the infrastructure to conduct robust workforce development research, the project will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the role and impact of peer networks on STEM workforce development<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, hands-on cyber security exercises helped students reinforce basic concepts, but most of them focused on user level attacks and defenses. Since OS kernels provide the foundations to the applications, any compromise to OS kernels will lead to an entirely untrusted computing. Therefore, it is imperative to teach students the practice of kernel level attacks and defenses.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, there has been great interest in using virtualization to profile, characterize, and observe kernel events including the security incidents. Inspired by the great success from virtual machine introspection (VMI), this project aims to provide an advancement by directly building practical VMI tools and libraries (or toolkit) on top of virtualization, and applying them for deep cybersecurity education. The deepness comes from the study of the lower level system internals such as OS kernels. The project will further provide a number of seed contents to teach both instructors and students on utilizing the toolkit to be used for studying not only traditional user level attacks such as buffer overflow, but also defenses inside the OS kernels. The outcome of this project (i.e., the toolkit and the cybersecurity exercises) will contribute to the health, safety, and economic well-being of our society by helping to improve the state-of-the-art in cybersecurity education, especially for effectively performing hands-on cybersecurity exercises."
